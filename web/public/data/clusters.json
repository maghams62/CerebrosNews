          "summary": "- \"A mega rocket set to take astronauts around the Moon for the first time in decades is being taken to its launch pad,\" the BBC reported this morning. NASA is livestreaming their move of the 11-million-pound \"stack\" — which includes the Artemis II Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion spacecraft secured to it, all standing on its Mobile Launch Platform. Travelling at less than 1 mile per hour, the move is expected to take 12 hours. The mission — which could blast off as soon as 6 February — is expected to take 10 days. It is part of a wider plan aimed at returning astronauts to the lunar surface. As well as the rocket being ready, the Moon has to be in the right place too, so successive launch windows are selected accordingly. In practice, this means one week at the beginning of each month during which the rocket is pointed in the right direction followed by three weeks where there are no launch opportunities. The potential launch dates are: — 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11 February — 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 March — 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 April \"The crew of four will travel beyond the far side of the moon, which could set a new record for the farthest distance humans have ever traveled from Earth, currently held by Apollo 13,\" reports CNN: But why won't Artemis II land on the lunar surface? \"The short answer is because it doesn't have the capability. This is not a lunar lander,\" said Patty Casas Horn, deputy lead for Mission Analysis and Integrated Assessments at NASA. \"Throughout the history of NASA, everything that we do is a bit risky, and so we want to make sure that that risk makes sense, and only accept the risk that we have to accept, within reason. So we build out a capability, then we test it out, then we build out a capability, then we test it out. And we will get to landing on the moon, but Artemis II is really about the crew...\" The upcoming flight is the first time that people will be on board the Artemis spacecraft: The Orion capsule will carry the astronauts around the moon, and the SLS rocket will launch Orion into Earth orbit before the crew continues deeper into space... The mission will begin with two revolutions around Earth, before starting the translunar injection — the maneuver that will take the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and on toward the moon — about 26 hours into the flight, Horn said. \"That's when we set up for the big burn — it's about six minutes in duration. And once we do this, you're on your way back to Earth. There's nothing else that you need to do. You're going to go by the moon, and the moon's gravity is going to pull you around and swing you back towards the Earth....\" Avoiding entering lunar orbit keeps the mission profile simpler, allowing the crew to focus on other tasks as there is no need to pilot the spacecraft in any way. \"The Artemis program's first planned lunar lander is called the Starship HLS, or Human Landing System, and is currently under development by SpaceX...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

          "summary": "- The senior editor at the blog Windows Central decries two serious Windows issues \"that were not spotted by Microsoft during testing, and are so severe that the company has now issued an emergency fix to address the problems.\" Microsoft's first update for Windows 11 in 2026 has already caused two major issues that saw users unable to fully shutdown their PCs or sign-in into a device when using Remote Desktop... Being unable to shut down your PC due to a recent OS update is a huge oversight on Microsoft's part, but this is the latest in a long list of updates over the last year to cause a major issue like this... Other issues that have cropped up in Windows 11 in the last year include a bug that caused Task Manager to fail to close when the user exited the application, causing system resources to lock up after a prolonged period of time if the user had opened and closed Task Manager multiple times in a session. Another update caused saw File Explorer flashbang users with a white screen when opening it in dark mode, which appeared in an update that was supposed to improve dark mode on Windows 11... For whatever reason, the Windows Insider Program doesn't appear to be working anymore, as severe bugs are somehow making it into shipping versions of the OS. \"The out of band updates, KB5077744 and KB5077797, are available now via Windows Update and is rolling out to everybody,\" they write. \"Once installed, your PC should go back to being able to shut down successfully, and signing-in via Remote Desktop should work again.\" Microsoft has also officially acknowledged a third bug which crashes Outlook Classic when using POP accounts, according to the blog Windows Latest, which adds that that bug has not yet been fixed. They've also identified other minor bugs, including \"a black screen problem in Windows 11 KB5074109... either due to the update itself or some compatibility issues with GPU drivers.\" After you install the January 2026 Update, Windows triggers random black screens where the desktop freezes for a second or two, the display goes black, then everything comes back. I can't pinpoint any specific configuration, but I can confirm the black screen issue has been observed on a small subset of PCs with both Nvidia and AMD GPUs.

          "summary": "- If you weren't able to shut down your Windows 11 device recently, Microsoft has rolled out an emergency fix addressing a couple of critical bugs that popped up with its latest January 2026 Windows security update. The latest \"out-of-band\" update repairs an issue for some Windows 11 devices that would only restart when users tried to shut down or hibernate. The same update restores the ability for Windows 10 and Windows 11 users to log into their devices via remote connection apps. Microsoft said the inability to shut down or hibernate affected Windows 11 devices using Secure Launch, a security feature that protects a computer from firmware-level attacks during startup. As for the remote connection issue, Microsoft explained in its Known issues page that credential prompt failures were responsible when users tried to log in remotely to affected Windows 10 and 11 devices. According to WindowsLatest, some lingering issues with the January 2026 Windows security update are still affecting users, like seeing blank screens or Outlook Classic crashing. Back in October, Microsoft had to issue another emergency fix for Windows 11 related to the Windows Recovery Environment. For those still hesitant to upgrade to Windows 11, Microsoft is allowing you to squeeze some more life out of Windows 10 by enrolling in Extended Security Updates.

Being unable to shut down your PC due to a recent OS update is a huge oversight on Microsoft's part, but this is the latest in a long list of updates over the last year to cause a major issue like this... Other issues that have cropped up in Windows 11 in the last year include a bug that caused Task Manager to fail to close when the user exited the application, causing system resources to lock up after a prolonged period of time if the user had opened and closed Task Manager multiple times in a session. Another update caused saw File Explorer flashbang users with a white screen when opening it in dark mode, which appeared in an update that was supposed to improve dark mode on Windows 11... For whatever reason, the Windows Insider Program doesn't appear to be working anymore, as severe bugs are somehow making it into shipping versions of the OS. \"The out of band updates, KB5077744 and KB5077797, are available now via Windows Update and is rolling out to everybody,\" they write. \"Once installed, your PC should go back to being able to shut down successfully, and signing-in via Remote Desktop should work again.\" Microsoft has also officially acknowledged a third bug which crashes Outlook Classic when using POP accounts, according to the blog Windows Latest, which adds that that bug has not yet been fixed. They've also identified other minor bugs, including \"a black screen problem in Windows 11 KB5074109... either due to the update itself or some compatibility issues with GPU drivers.\" After you install the January 2026 Update, Windows triggers random black screens where the desktop freezes for a second or two, the display goes black, then everything comes back. I can't pinpoint any specific configuration, but I can confirm the black screen issue has been observed on a small subset of PCs with both Nvidia and AMD GPUs.

          "summary": "- Now would be a good time to update all your Bluetooth audio devices. On Thursday, Wired reported on a security flaw in 17 headphone and speaker models that could allow hackers to access your devices, including their microphones. The vulnerability stems from a faulty implementation of Google's one-tap (Fast Pair) protocol. Security researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group, who discovered the security hole, named the flaw WhisperPair. They say a hacker within Bluetooth range would only require the accessory's (easily attainable) device model number and a few seconds. \"You're walking down the street with your headphones on, you're listening to some music. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,\" KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta told Wired. \"Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. I can inject audio. I can track your location.\" The researchers notified Google about WhisperPair in August, and the company has been working with them since then. Fast Pair is supposed to only allow new connections while the audio device is in pairing mode. (A proper implementation of this would have prevented this flaw.) But a Google spokesperson told Engadget that the vulnerability stemmed from an improper implementation of Fast Pair by some of its hardware partners. This could then allow a hacker's device to pair with your headphones or speaker after it's already paired with your device. \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe,\" a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to Engadget. \"We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\" The researchers created the video below to demonstrate how the flaw works In an email to Engadget, Google said the steps required to access the device’s microphone or audio are complex and involve multiple stages. The attackers would also need to remain within Bluetooth range. The company added that it provided its OEM partners with recommended fixes in September. Google also updated its Validator certification tool and its certification requirements. The researchers say that, in some cases, the risk applies even to those who don't use Android phones. For example, if the audio accessory has never been paired with a Google account, a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the audio device but also link it to their own Google account. They could then use Google's Find Hub tool to track the device's (and therefore your) location. Google said it rolled out a fix to its Find Hub network to address that particular scenario. However, the researchers told Wired that, within hours of the patch’s rollout, they found a workaround. The 17 affected devices are made by 10 different companies, all of which received Google Fast Pair certification. They include Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. (Google says its affected Pixel Buds are already patched and protected.) The researchers posted a search tool that lets you see if your audio accessories are vulnerable. In a statement sent to Engadget, OnePlus said it's investigating the issue and \"will take appropriate action to protect our users' security and privacy.\" Marshall said it patched the issue in November and is working with Google to avoid similar issues in the future (see full statement below). We also contacted the other accessory makers and will update this story if we hear back. The researchers recommend updating your audio devices regularly. However, one of their concerns is that many people will never install the third-party manufacturer's app (required for updates), leaving their devices vulnerable. The full report from Wired has much more detail and is worth a read. Update, January 15 2026, 4:04PM ET: “We can confirm that Marshall has issued the necessary firmware updates and security patches to address the headphones potentially affected,” a company representative told Engadget. “These updates have been available since November and have been offered to all users since then. While this is an industry-wide issue, we take it seriously and are working closely with Google to reduce the risk of similar vulnerabilities in the future.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/flaw-in-17-google-fast-pair-audio-devices-could-let-hackers-eavesdrop-194613456.html?src=rss",

          "summary": "- OpenAI plans to start testing ads inside of ChatGPT \"in the coming weeks.\" In a blog post published Friday, the company said adult users in the US of its free and Go tiers (more on the latter in a moment) would start seeing sponsored products and services appear below their conversations with its chatbot. \"Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer,\" OpenAI said, adding any sponsored spots would not influence the answers ChatGPT generates. \"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you.\" OpenAI says people won't see ads appear when they're talking to ChatGPT about sensitive subjects like their health, mental state of mind or current politics. The company also won't show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won't share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. \"We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,\" OpenAI adds. Users can dismiss ads, at which point they'll be asked to explain why they didn't engage with it. Users will be able to ask follow-up questions about sponsored content. OpenAI \"Given what AI can do, we're excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,\" OpenAI said. However, the company was also quick to note its \"long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for.\" To that point, OpenAI said it would also make its ChatGPT Go subscription available to users in the US. The company first launched the tier in India last August, marketing it as a low-cost alternative to its more expensive Plus and Pro offerings. In the US, Go will cost $8 per month — or $12 less than the monthly price of the Plus plan — and offer 10 times higher rate limits for messages, file uploads and image creation than the free tier. The subscription also extends ChatGPT's memory and context window, meaning the chatbot will be better at remembering details from past conversations. That said, you'll see ads at this tier. To go ad-free, you'll need to subscribe to one of OpenAI's more expensive plans. For consumers, that means either the Plus or Pro plans. According to reports, OpenAI had been testing ads inside of ChatGPT since at least the end of last year. As companies continue to pay a high cost for model training and inference, all chatbots are likely to feature ads in some form.

ChatGPT Go provides expanded access to ChatGPT's latest model, GPT‑5.2 Instant, with 10× more messages, file uploads, and image creation allowed compared to the free tier. ChatGPT Go also offers longer memory than the free tier, so that ChatGPT can remember more information about you for a longer period. three subscription tiers worldwide: ChatGPT Go: $8/month ChatGPT Plus: $20/month ChatGPT Pro: $200/month ChatGPT's more advanced GPT‑5.2 Thinking model still requires ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Pro, for tasks that require deeper reasoning.

ChatGPT Plus and Pro will remain ad-free, as will ChatGPT Business and ChatGPT Enterprise. To start, OpenAI plans to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there is a relevant sponsored product or service based on the current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the answer. Users will be able to learn more about why they are seeing a particular ad, and any ad can be dismissed. OpenAI said ads will not influence the organic answers that ChatGPT gives users, and it ensured that conversations with ChatGPT will be kept private from advertisers, and that it will never sell user data to advertisers. OpenAI also promised there will always be at least one paid ChatGPT subscription tier available that is ad-free. Ads are not eligible to appear in ChatGPT conversations involving sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health, or politics, according to OpenAI. \"Ads support our commitment to making AI accessible to everyone by helping us keep ChatGPT available at free and affordable price points,\" said OpenAI.

          "summary": "- Meta is killing the standalone Workrooms app on February 16, 2026. The company presented Workrooms as a virtual reality space where teams can meet and collaborate in an immersive environment when it launched the product. Now Meta says its Horizon platform has evolved enough to support “a wide range of productivity apps and tools,” so it “made the decision to discontinue Workrooms as a standalone app.” The company recently slashed its spending on the metaverse and started the process to lay off more than 1,000 employees from its Reality Labs division. Due to those layoffs and organizational changes, it closed three of its VR studios. Reality Labs had lost more than $70 billion since 2021, and Meta told Engadget that it had decided to shift some of its investments from the metaverse towards wearables, such as its AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses. The company is also discontinuing Horizon managed services, its subscription service that helps organizations manage their Quest headsets, in February. Users will no longer be able to access the Workrooms app or any of their data in it starting on February 16. Meta is allowing people to download their data if they need it until that date.

But there's now been new research by Jamf (the company behind a mobile device management solution) showing Predator is more dangerous and sophisticated than we realized, according to SecurityWeek. Long-time Slashdot reader wiredmikey writes: The new research reveals an error taxonomy that reports exactly why deployments fail, turning black boxes into diagnostic events for threat actors. Almost exclusively marketed to and used by national governments and intelligence agencies, the spyware also detects cybersecurity tools, suppresses forensics evidence, and has built-in geographic restrictions.

          "title": "Black Forest Labs launches open source Flux.2 [klein] to generate AI images in less than a second",
          "summary": "- The German AI startup Black Forest Labs (BFL), founded by former Stability AI engineers, is continuing to build out its suite of open source AI image generators with the release of FLUX.2 [klein], a new pair of small models — one open and one non-commercial — that emphasizes speed and lower compute requirements, with the models generating images in less than a second on a Nvidia GB200. The [klein] series, released yesterday, includes two primary parameter counts: 4 billion (4B) and 9 billion (9B). The model weights are available on Hugging Face and code on Github. While the larger models in the FLUX.2 family ([max] and [pro]), released in November of 2025, chase the limits of photorealism and \"grounding search\" capabilities, [klein] is designed specifically for consumer hardware and latency-critical workflows. In great news for enterprises, the 4B version is available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning they — or any organization or developer — can use the [klein] models for their commercial purposes without paying BFL or any intermediaries a dime. However, a number of AI image and media creation platforms including Fal.ai have begun offering it for extremely low cost as well through their application programming interfaces (APIs) and as a direct-to-user tool. Already, it's won strong praise from early users for its speed. What it lacks for in overall image quality, it seems to make up for in its fast generation capability, open license, affordability and small footprint — benefitting enterprises who want to run image models on their own hardware or at extremely low cost. So how did BFL do it and how can it benefit you? Read on to learn more. The \"Pareto Frontier\" of Latency The technical philosophy behind [klein] is what BFL documentation describes as defining the \"Pareto frontier\" for quality versus latency. In simple terms, they have attempted to squeeze the maximum possible visual fidelity into a model small enough to run on a home gaming PC without a noticeable lag. The performance metrics released by the company paint a picture of a model built for interactivity rather than just batch generation. According to Black Forest Labs' official figures, the [klein] models are capable of generating or editing images in under 0.5 seconds on modern hardware. Even on standard consumer GPUs like an RTX 3090 or 4070, the 4B model is designed to fit comfortably within approximately 13GB of VRAM. This speed is achieved through \"distillation,\" a process where a larger, more complex model \"teaches\" a smaller, more efficient one to approximate its outputs in fewer steps. The distilled [klein] variants require only four steps to generate an image. This effectively turns the generation process from a coffee-break task into a near-instantaneous one, enabling what BFL describes on X (formerly Twitter) as \"developing ideas from 0 → 1\" in real-time. Under the Hood: Unified Architecture Historically, image generation and image editing have often required different pipelines or complex adapters (like ControlNets). FLUX.2 [klein] attempts to unify these. The architecture natively supports text-to-image, single-reference editing, and multi-reference composition without needing to swap models. According to the documentation released on GitHub, the models support: Multi-Reference Editing: Users can upload up to four reference images (or ten in the playground) to guide the style or structure of the output. Hex-Code Color Control: A frequent pain point for designers is getting \"that exact shade of red.\" The new models accept specific hex codes in prompts (e.g., #800020) to force precise color rendering. Structured Prompting: The model parses JSON-like structured inputs for rigorously defined compositions, a feature clearly aimed at programmatic generation and enterprise pipelines. The Licensing Split: Open Weights vs. Open Source For startups and developers building on top of BFL’s tech, understanding the licensing landscape of this release is critical. BFL has adopted a split strategy that separates \"hobbyist/research\" use from \"commercial infrastructure.\" FLUX.2 [klein] 4B: Released under Apache 2.0. This is a permissive free software license that allows for commercial use, modification, and redistribution. If you are building a paid app, a SaaS platform, or a game that integrates AI generation, you can use the 4B model royalty-free. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B & [dev]: Released under the FLUX Non-Commercial License. These weights are open for researchers and hobbyists to download and experiment with, but they cannot be used for commercial applications without a separate agreement. This distinction positions the 4B model as a direct competitor to other open-weights models like Stable Diffusion 3 Medium or SDXL, but with a more modern architecture and a permissive license that removes legal ambiguity for startups. Ecosystem Integration: ComfyUI and Beyond BFL is clearly aware that a model is only as good as the tools that run it. Coinciding with the model drop, the team released official workflow templates for ComfyUI, the node-based interface that has become the standard integrated development environment (IDE) for AI artists. The workflows—specifically image_flux2_klein_text_to_image.json and the editing variants—allow users to drag and drop the new capabilities into existing pipelines immediately. Community reaction on social media has centered on this workflow integration and the speed. In a post on X, the official Black Forest Labs account highlighted the model's ability to \"rapidly explore a specific aesthetic,\" showcasing a video where the style of an image shifted instantly as the user scrubbed through options. Why It Matters For Enterprise AI Decision-Makers The release of FLUX.2 [klein] signals a maturation in the generative AI market, moving past the initial phase of novelty into a period defined by utility, integration, and speed. For Lead AI Engineers who are constantly juggling the need to balance speed with quality, this shift is pivotal. These professionals, who manage the full lifecycle of models from data preparation to deployment, often face the daily challenge of integrating rapidly evolving tools into existing workflows. The availability of a distilled 4B model under an Apache 2.0 license offers a practical solution for those focused on rapid deployment and fine-tuning to achieve specific business goals, allowing them to bypass the latency bottlenecks that typically plague high-fidelity image generation. For Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and automation, the implications are equally significant. These experts are responsible for building scalable AI pipelines and maintaining model integrity across different environments, often while working under strict budget constraints. The lightweight nature of the [klein] family directly addresses the challenge of implementing efficient systems with limited resources. By utilizing a model that fits within consumer-grade VRAM, orchestration specialists can architect cost-effective, local inference pipelines that avoid the heavy operational costs associated with massive proprietary models. Even for the Director of IT Security, the move toward capable, locally runnable open-weight models offers a distinct advantage. Tasked with protecting the organization from cyber threats and managing security operations with limited resources, reliance on external APIs for sensitive creative workflows can be a vulnerability. A high-quality model that runs locally allows security leaders to sanction AI tools that keep proprietary data within the corporate firewall, balancing the operational demands of the business with the robust security measures they are required to uphold.",

          "title": "Nvidia’s New Rubin Architecture Thrives on Networking",
          "summary": "Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new platform, set to reach customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture. The usual suspect for improved performance is the GPU. Indeed, the new Rubin GPU boasts 50 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (petaFLOPS) of 4-bit computation, as compared to 10 petaflops on Blackwell, at least for transformer-based inference workloads like large language models. However, focusing on just the GPU misses the bigger picture. There are a total of six new chips in the Vera Rubin-based computers: the Vera CPU, the Rubin GPU, and four distinct networking chips. To achieve performance advantages, the components have to work in concert, says Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia. “The same unit connected in a different way will deliver a completely different level of performance,” Shainer says. “That’s why we call it extreme co-design.” Expanded “in-network compute” AI workloads, both training and inference, run on large numbers of GPUs simultaneously. “Two years back, inferencing was mainly run on a single GPU, a single box, a single server,” Shainer says. “Right now, inferencing is becoming distributed, and it’s not just in a rack. It’s going to go across racks.” To accommodate these hugely distributed tasks, as many GPUs as possible need to effectively work as one. This is the aim of the so-called scale-up network: the connection of GPUs within a single rack. Nvidia handles this connection with their NVLink networking chip. The new line includes the NVLink6 switch, with double the bandwidth of the previous version (3,600 gigabytes per second for GPU-to-GPU connections, as compared to 1,800 GB/s for the NVLink5 switch). In addition to the bandwidth doubling, the scale-up chips also include double the number of SerDes—serializer/deserializers (which allow data to be sent across fewer wires)—and an expanded number of calculations that can be done within the network. “The scale-up network is not really the network itself,” Shainer says. “It’s computing infrastructure, and some of the computing operations are done on the network…on the switch.” The rationale for offloading some operations from the GPUs to the network is twofold. First, it allows some tasks to only be done once, rather than having every GPU have to perform them. A common example of this is the all-reduce operation in AI training. During training, each GPU computes a mathematical operation, called a gradient, on its own batch of data. In order to train the model correctly, all the GPUs need to know the average gradient computed across all batches. Rather than each GPU sending its gradient to every other GPU, and every one of them computing the average, it saves computational time and power for that operation to only happen once, within the network. A second rationale is to hide the time it takes to shuttle data in between GPUs by doing computations on them en route. Shainer explains this via an analogy of a pizza parlor trying to speed up the time it takes to deliver an order. “What can you do if you had more ovens or more workers? It doesn’t help you; you can make more pizzas, but the time for a single pizza is going to stay the same. Alternatively, if you would take the oven and put it in a car, so I’m going to bake the pizza while traveling to you, this is where I save time. This is what we do.” In-network computing is not new to this iteration of Nvidia’s architecture. In fact, it has been in common use since around 2016. But, this iteration adds a broader swath of computations that can be done within the network to accommodate different workloads and different numerical formats, Shainer says. Scaling out and across The rest of the networking chips included in the Rubin architecture comprise the so-called scale-out network. This is the part that connects different racks to each other within the data center. Those chips are the ConnectX-9, a networking interface card; the BlueField-4 a so-called data processing unit, which is paired with two Vera CPUs and a ConnectX-9 card for offloading networking, storage, and security tasks; and finally the Spectrum-6 Ethernet switch, which uses co-packaged optics to send data between racks. The Ethernet switch also doubles the bandwidth of the previous generations while minimizing jitter—the variation in arrival times of information packets. “Scale-out infrastructure needs to make sure that those GPUs can communicate well in order to run a distributed computing workload, and that means I need a network that has no jitter in it,” he says. The presence of jitter implies that if different racks are doing different parts of the calculation, the answer from each will arrive at different times. One rack will always be slower than the rest, and the rest of the racks, full of costly equipment, sit idle while waiting for that last packet. “Jitter means losing money,” Shainer says. None of Nvidia’s host of new chips are specifically dedicated to connect between data centers, termed “scale-across.” But Shainer argues this is the next frontier. “It doesn’t stop here, because we are seeing the demands to increase the number of GPUs in a data center,” he says. “100,000 GPUs is not enough anymore for some workloads, and now we need to connect multiple data centers together.”",

These generic tables, which work against multiple hashing schemes, allow hackers to take over accounts by quickly mapping a stolen hash to its password counterpart... Mandiant said it had released an NTLMv1 rainbow table that will allow defenders and researchers (and, of course, malicious hackers, too) to recover passwords in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. The table is hosted in Google Cloud. The database works against Net-NTLMv1 passwords, which are used in network authentication for accessing resources such as SMB network sharing. Despite its long- and well-known susceptibility to easy cracking, NTLMv1 remains in use in some of the world's more sensitive networks. One reason for the lack of action is that utilities and organizations in industries, including health care and industrial control, often rely on legacy apps that are incompatible with more recently released hashing algorithms.

          "summary": "- Every year, NeurIPS produces hundreds of impressive papers, and a handful that subtly reset how practitioners think about scaling, evaluation and system design. In 2025, the most consequential works weren't about a single breakthrough model. Instead, they challenged fundamental assumptions that academicians and corporations have quietly relied on: Bigger models mean better reasoning, RL creates new capabilities, attention is “solved” and generative models inevitably memorize. This year’s top papers collectively point to a deeper shift: AI progress is now constrained less by raw model capacity and more by architecture, training dynamics and evaluation strategy. Below is a technical deep dive into five of the most influential NeurIPS 2025 papers — and what they mean for anyone building real-world AI systems. 1. LLMs are converging—and we finally have a way to measure it Paper: Artificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of Language Models For years, LLM evaluation has focused on correctness. But in open-ended or ambiguous tasks like brainstorming, ideation or creative synthesis, there often is no single correct answer. The risk instead is homogeneity: Models producing the same “safe,” high-probability responses. This paper introduces Infinity-Chat, a benchmark designed explicitly to measure diversity and pluralism in open-ended generation. Rather than scoring answers as right or wrong, it measures: Intra-model collapse: How often the same model repeats itself Inter-model homogeneity: How similar different models’ outputs are The result is uncomfortable but important: Across architectures and providers, models increasingly converge on similar outputs — even when multiple valid answers exist. Why this matters in practice For corporations, this reframes “alignment” as a trade-off. Preference tuning and safety constraints can quietly reduce diversity, leading to assistants that feel too safe, predictable or biased toward dominant viewpoints. Takeaway: If your product relies on creative or exploratory outputs, diversity metrics need to be first-class citizens. 2. Attention isn’t finished — a simple gate changes everything Paper: Gated Attention for Large Language Models Transformer attention has been treated as settled engineering. This paper proves it isn’t. The authors introduce a small architectural change: Apply a query-dependent sigmoid gate after scaled dot-product attention, per attention head. That’s it. No exotic kernels, no massive overhead. Across dozens of large-scale training runs — including dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models trained on trillions of tokens — this gated variant: Improved stability Reduced “attention sinks” Enhanced long-context performance Consistently outperformed vanilla attention Why it works The gate introduces: Non-linearity in attention outputs Implicit sparsity, suppressing pathological activations This challenges the assumption that attention failures are purely data or optimization problems. Takeaway: Some of the biggest LLM reliability issues may be architectural — not algorithmic — and solvable with surprisingly small changes. 3. RL can scale — if you scale in depth, not just data Paper: 1,000-Layer Networks for Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning Conventional wisdom says RL doesn’t scale well without dense rewards or demonstrations. This paper reveals that that assumption is incomplete. By scaling network depth aggressively from typical 2 to 5 layers to nearly 1,000 layers, the authors demonstrate dramatic gains in self-supervised, goal-conditioned RL, with performance improvements ranging from 2X to 50X. The key isn’t brute force. It’s pairing depth with contrastive objectives, stable optimization regimes and goal-conditioned representations Why this matters beyond robotics For agentic systems and autonomous workflows, this suggests that representation depth — not just data or reward shaping — may be a critical lever for generalization and exploration. Takeaway: RL’s scaling limits may be architectural, not fundamental. 4. Why diffusion models generalize instead of memorizing Paper: Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training Diffusion models are massively overparameterized, yet they often generalize remarkably well. This paper explains why. The authors identify two distinct training timescales: One where generative quality rapidly improves Another — much slower — where memorization emerges Crucially, the memorization timescale grows linearly with dataset size, creating a widening window where models improve without overfitting. Practical implications This reframes early stopping and dataset scaling strategies. Memorization isn’t inevitable — it’s predictable and delayed. Takeaway: For diffusion training, dataset size doesn’t just improve quality — it actively delays overfitting. 5. RL improves reasoning performance, not reasoning capacity Paper: Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning in LLMs? Perhaps the most strategically important result of NeurIPS 2025 is also the most sobering. This paper rigorously tests whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) actually creates new reasoning abilities in LLMs — or simply reshapes existing ones. Their conclusion: RLVR primarily improves sampling efficiency, not reasoning capacity. At large sample sizes, the base model often already contains the correct reasoning trajectories. What this means for LLM training pipelines RL is better understood as: A distribution-shaping mechanism Not a generator of fundamentally new capabilities Takeaway: To truly expand reasoning capacity, RL likely needs to be paired with mechanisms like teacher distillation or architectural changes — not used in isolation. The bigger picture: AI progress is becoming systems-limited Taken together, these papers point to a common theme: The bottleneck in modern AI is no longer raw model size — it’s system design. Diversity collapse requires new evaluation metrics Attention failures require architectural fixes RL scaling depends on depth and representation Memorization depends on training dynamics, not parameter count Reasoning gains depend on how distributions are shaped, not just optimized For builders, the message is clear: Competitive advantage is shifting from “who has the biggest model” to “who understands the system.” Maitreyi Chatterjee is a software engineer.

          "title": "How Google’s 'internal RL' could unlock long-horizon AI agents",
          "summary": "- Researchers at Google have developed a technique that makes it easier for AI models to learn complex reasoning tasks that usually cause LLMs to hallucinate or fall apart. Instead of training LLMs through next-token prediction, their technique, called internal reinforcement learning (internal RL), steers the model’s internal activations toward developing a high-level step-by-step solution for the input problem. Ultimately, this could provide a scalable path for creating autonomous agents that can handle complex reasoning and real-world robotics without needing constant, manual guidance. The limits of next-token prediction Reinforcement learning plays a key role in post-training LLMs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, the problem lies in the architecture of these models. LLMs are autoregressive, meaning they generate sequences one token at a time. When these models explore new strategies during training, they do so by making small, random changes to the next single token or action. This exposes a deeper limitation: next-token prediction forces models to search for solutions at the wrong level of abstraction, making long-horizon reasoning inefficient even when the model “knows” what to do. This token-by-token approach works well for basic language modeling but breaks down in long-horizon tasks where rewards are sparse. If the model relies solely on random token-level sampling, the probability of stumbling upon the correct multi-step solution is infinitesimally small, \"on the order of one in a million,\" according to the researchers. The issue isn't just that the models get confused; it’s that they get confused at the wrong level. In comments provided to VentureBeat, Yanick Schimpf, a co-author of the paper, notes that in a 20-step task, an agent can get lost in the minute details of a single step, or it can lose track of the overall goal. \"We argue that when facing a problem with some abstract structure... [goal-oriented exploration] is what you want,\" Schimpf said. By solving the problem at the abstract level first, the agent commits to a path, ensuring it doesn't \"get lost in one of the reasoning steps\" and fail to complete the broader workflow. To address this, the field has long looked toward hierarchical reinforcement learning. HRL attempts to solve complex problems by decomposing them into a hierarchy of temporally abstract actions (high-level subroutines that represent different stages of the solution) rather than managing a task as a string of tokens. However, discovering these appropriate subroutines remains a longstanding challenge. Current HRL methods often fail to discover proper policies, frequently \"converging to degenerate options\" that do not represent meaningful behaviors. Even sophisticated modern methods like GRPO (a popular RL algorithm used for sparse-reward tasks) fail in complex environments because they cannot effectively bridge the gap between low-level execution and high-level planning. Steering the LLM's internal thoughts To overcome these limitations, the Google team proposed internal RL. Advanced autoregressive models already \"know\" how to perform complex, multi-step tasks internally, even if they aren't explicitly trained to do so. Because these complex behaviors are hidden inside the model's residual stream (i.e., the numerical values that carry information through the network's layers), the researchers introduced an \"internal neural network controller,\" or metacontroller. Instead of monitoring and changing the output token, the metacontroller controls the model’s behavior by applying changes to the model's internal activations in the middle layers. This nudge steers the model into a specific useful state. The base model then automatically generates the sequence of individual steps needed to achieve that goal because it has already seen those patterns during its initial pretraining. The metacontroller operates through unsupervised learning and does not require human-labeled training examples. Instead, the researchers use a self-supervised framework where the model analyzes a full sequence of behavior and works backward to infer the hidden, high-level intent that best explains the actions. During the internal RL phase, the updates are applied to the metacontroller, which shifts training from next-token prediction to learning high-level actions that can lead to the solution. To understand the practical value of this, consider an enterprise agent tasked with code generation. Today, there is a difficult trade-off: You need \"low temperature\" (predictability) to get the syntax right, but \"high temperature\" (creativity) to solve the logic puzzle. \"Internal RL might facilitate this by allowing the model to explore the space of abstract actions, i.e. structuring logic and method calls, while delegating the token-level realization of those actions to the robust, lower-temperature distribution of the base model,\" Schimpf said. The agent explores the solution without breaking the syntax. The researchers investigated two methods for applying this controller. In the first, the base autoregressive model is pretrained on a behavioral dataset and then frozen, while the metacontroller is trained to steer the frozen model's residual stream. In the second, the metacontroller and the base model are jointly optimized, with parameters of both networks updated simultaneously. Internal RL in action To evaluate the effectiveness of internal RL, the researchers ran experiments across hierarchical environments designed to stump traditional learners. These included a discrete grid world and a continuous control task where a quadrupedal \"ant\" robot must coordinate joint movements. Both environments used sparse rewards with very long action sequences. While baselines like GRPO and CompILE failed to learn the tasks within a million episodes due to the difficulty of credit assignment over long horizons, internal RL achieved high success rates with a small number of training episodes. By choosing high-level goals rather than tiny steps, the metacontroller drastically reduced the search space. This allowed the model to identify which high-level decisions led to success, making credit assignment efficient enough to solve the sparse reward problem. Notably, the researchers found that the \"frozen\" approach was superior. When the base model and metacontroller were co-trained from scratch, the system failed to develop meaningful abstractions. However, applied to a frozen model, the metacontroller successfully discovered key checkpoints without any human labels, perfectly aligning its internal switching mechanism with the ground-truth moments when an agent finished one subgoal and started the next. As the industry currently fixates on reasoning models that output verbose \"chains of thought\" to solve problems, Google’s research points toward a different, perhaps more efficient future. \"Our study joins a growing body of work suggesting that 'internal reasoning' is not only feasible but potentially more efficient than token-based approaches,\" Schimpf said. \"Moreover, these silent 'thoughts' can be decoupled from specific input modalities — a property that could be particularly relevant for the future of multi-modal AI.\" If internal reasoning can be guided without being externalized, the future of AI agents may hinge less on prompting strategies and more on how well we can access and steer what models already represent internally. For enterprises betting on autonomous systems that must plan, adapt, and act over long horizons, that shift could matter more than any new reasoning benchmark.",

          "summary": "- We now have some idea of what's at stake in the longstanding feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI. As first reported by Bloomberg, the latest filing, as part of a lawsuit that accuses the AI giant of abandoning its non-profit status, claims that Musk is owed anywhere between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages from the \"wrongful gains\" of OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk claimed in the filing that he's entitled to a portion of OpenAI's recent valuation at $500 billion, after contributing $38 million in \"seed funding\" during the AI company's startup years. Along with providing \"roughly 60 percent of the nonprofit's seed funding,\" Musk offered recruiting of key employees, introductions with business contacts and startup advice, according to the filing. The monetary estimate comes from C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist who's serving as Musk's expert in the case. According to Wazzan's calculations, OpenAI earned between $65.5 billion and $109.43 billion in wrongful gains, while Microsoft saw between $13.3 billion and $25.06 billion. The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI dates back to March 2024, when the xAI CEO first filed a legal action claiming that OpenAI violated its non-profit status. Musk later added Microsoft as another defendant and even tried to get an injunction when OpenAI announced efforts to reorganize its corporate structure. Besides this suit, Musk has named OpenAI in another legal battle, accusing the company, along with Apple, of monopolistic practices that prevent xAI from getting a fair shot in the App Store.

          "title": "Nvidia: End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context aka Being Able To Update A Model's Weights In Real-Time As You Use It | \"TTT changes the paradigm from retrieving info to learning it on the fly...the TTT model treats the context window as a dataset & trains itself on it in real-time.\" [R]",
          "summary": "TL;DR: The paper describes a mechanism that essentially turns the context window into a training dataset for a \"fast weight\" update loop: Inner Loop: The model runs a mini-gradient descent on the context during inference. It updates specific MLP layers to \"learn\" the current context. Outer Loop: The model's initial weights are meta-learned during training to be \"highly updateable\" or optimized for this test-time adaptation From the Paper: \"Overall, our empirical observations strongly indicate that TTT-E2E should produce the same trend as full attention for scaling with training compute in large-budget production runs.\" Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7x faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available. Layman's Explanation: Think of this paper as solving the memory bottleneck by fundamentally changing how a model processes information. Imagine you are taking a massive open-book exam. A standard Transformer (like GPT-4) is the student who frantically re-reads every single page of the textbook before answering every single question. This strategy guarantees they find the specific details (perfect recall), but as the textbook gets thicker, they get exponentially slower until they simply cannot finish the test in time. On the other hand, alternatives like RNNs or Mamba try to summarize the entire textbook onto a single index card. They can answer questions instantly because they don't have to look back at the book, but for long, complex subjects, they eventually run out of space on the card and start forgetting crucial information. This new method, Test-Time Training (TTT), changes the paradigm from retrieving information to learning it on the fly. Instead of re-reading the book or summarizing it onto a card, the TTT model treats the context window as a dataset and actually trains itself on it in real-time. It performs a mini-gradient descent update on its own neural weights as it reads. This is equivalent to a student who reads the textbook and physically rewires their brain to master the subject matter before the test. Because the information is now compressed into the model's actual intelligence (its weights) rather than a temporary cache, the model can answer questions instantly (matching the constant speed of the fast index-card models) but with the high accuracy and scaling capability of the slow, page-turning Transformers. This effectively decouples intelligence from memory costs, allowing for massive context lengths without the usual slowdown.

          "title": "Are There Enough Engineers for the AI Boom?",
          "summary": "- The AI data center construction boom continues unabated, with the demand for power in the United States potentially reaching 106 gigawatts by 2035, according to a December report from research and analysis company BloombergNEF. That’s a 36 percent jump from the company’s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and—perhaps most significantly—a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust. The power grid engineering workforce is currently shrinking, and data center operators are also hurting for trained electrical engineers. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for Applied Digital, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter. “As we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,” says Laltrello. “We are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn’t have to come from a data center background.” Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management’s (AFCOM) State of the Data Center Report 2025, 58 percent of data center managers identified multi-skilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need. Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost 400,000 more construction workers by 2033. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing and HVAC, and roughly 17,500 electrical and electronics engineers. These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers. “The challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,” says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm Apolo. “Data centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool and AI is amplifying this pressure.” Data center developers like Lancium and construction firms like Crusoe face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they’re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October of 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power. Michael McNamara, the CEO of Lancium, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require one gigawatt of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less. That kind of ramp up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) integration, says Matthew Hawkins, the director of education for Uptime Institute. “Demand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,” says Hawkins. Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering’s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco. “Technical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,” says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM. Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft’s Datacenter Academy is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. Google supports local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and Amazon offers data center apprenticeships. The Siemens Educates America program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations. The company has committed to training 200,000 electricians and electrical manufacturing workers by 2030. Similarly, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) operates the Electrical Training Alliance; the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) offers ToolingU-SME, aimed at expanding the manufacturing workforce; and Uptime Institute Education programs look to accelerate the readiness of technicians and operators. “Every university we speak with is thinking about this challenge and shifting its curriculum to prepare students for the future of digital infrastructure,” said Laltrello. “The best way to predict the future is to build it.”",

          "title": "How to Gain Footing in AI as the Ground Keeps Shifting",
          "summary": "The newly released Preparing for a Career as an AI Developer guide from the IEEE Computer Society argues that the most durable path to artificial intelligence jobs is not defined by mastering any single tool or model. Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills—capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace. AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze cybercrime, predict equipment failures in manufacturing, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to mass layoffs across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals. Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the banking, health care, retail, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making—and keep up with the competition. The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by San Murugesan and Rodica Neamtu. Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains. The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework. Why AI careers are being redefined AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy. Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write. The guide cites surveys of executives about AI’s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by McKinsey & Co. The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants’ insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate. The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve. Developing complementary skills The strategic approach aligns with advice from Neil Thompson, director of FutureTech research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,” he says. “Applying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.” The technical foundation still matters Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data, machine learning, and computing infrastructure. Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say. Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say. Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure is important, according to the guide’s authors. Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms. Python has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models. From algorithms to frameworks The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. PyTorch, developed by Meta AI, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. Scikit-learn provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. —Neil Thompson, MIT TensorFlow, a software library for machine learning and AI created by Google, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction. The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as résumé keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints. Soft skills as career insurance Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders. Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt. Experience before titles The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience. Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career. Entry-level roles that open doors Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide. Each starting point reinforces the guide’s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance. Curiosity as a long-term strategy Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process. “Always be curious,” he says. “Learn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.” Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one’s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend. In a field where today’s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide’s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.",

          "title": "AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse",
          "summary": "In recent months, I’ve noticed a troubling trend with AI coding assistants. After two years of steady improvements, over the course of 2025, most of the core models reached a quality plateau, and more recently, seem to be in decline. A task that might have taken five hours assisted by AI, and perhaps 10 hours without it, is now more commonly taking seven or eight hours, or even longer. It’s reached the point where I am sometimes going back and using older versions of large language models (LLMs). I use LLM-generated code extensively in my role as CEO of Carrington Labs, a provider of predictive-analytics risk models for lenders. My team has a sandbox where we create, deploy, and run AI-generated code without a human in the loop. We use them to extract useful features for model construction, a natural-selection approach to feature development. This gives me a unique vantage point from which to evaluate coding assistants’ performance. Newer models fail in insidious ways Until recently, the most common problem with AI coding assistants was poor syntax, followed closely by flawed logic. AI-created code would often fail with a syntax error or snarl itself up in faulty structure. This could be frustrating: The solution usually involved manually reviewing the code in detail and finding the mistake. But it was ultimately tractable. However, recently released LLMs, such as GPT-5, have a much more insidious method of failure. They often generate code that fails to perform as intended, but which on the surface seems to run successfully, avoiding syntax errors or obvious crashes. It does this by removing safety checks, or by creating fake output that matches the desired format, or through a variety of other techniques to avoid crashing during execution. As any developer will tell you, this kind of silent failure is far, far worse than a crash. Flawed outputs will often lurk undetected in code until they surface much later. This creates confusion and is far more difficult to catch and fix. This sort of behavior is so unhelpful that modern programming languages are deliberately designed to fail quickly and noisily. A simple test case I’ve noticed this problem anecdotally over the past several months, but recently, I ran a simple yet systematic test to determine whether it was truly getting worse. I wrote some Python code, which loaded a dataframe, and then looked for a nonexistent column. df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’) df['new_column'] = df['index_value'] + 1 #there is no column ‘index_value’ Obviously, this code would never run successfully. Python generates an easy-to-understand error message that explains that the column ‘index_value’ cannot be found. Any human seeing this message would inspect the dataframe and notice that the column was missing. I sent this error message to nine different versions of ChatGPT, primarily variations on GPT-4 and the more recent GPT-5. I asked each of them to fix the error, specifying that I wanted completed code only, without commentary. This is, of course, an impossible task—the problem is the missing data, not the code. So the best answer would be either an outright refusal, or failing that, code that would help me debug the problem. I ran 10 trials for each model and classified the output as helpful (when it suggested the column is probably missing from the dataframe), useless (something like just restating my question), or counterproductive (for example, creating fake data to avoid an error). GPT-4 gave a useful answer every one of the 10 times that I ran it. In three cases, it ignored my instructions to return only code, explained that the column was likely missing from my dataset, and that I would have to address it there. In six cases, it tried to execute the code but added an exception that would either throw up an error or fill the new column with an error message if the column couldn’t be found (the 10th time, it simply restated my original code). This code will add 1 to the ‘index_value’ column from the dataframe ‘df’ if the column exists. If the column ‘index_value’ does not exist, it will print a message. Please make sure the ‘index_value’ column exists and its name is spelled correctly.”, GPT-4.1 had an arguably even better solution. For nine of the 10 test cases, it simply printed the list of columns in the dataframe and included a comment in the code suggesting that I check to see if the column was present, and fix the issue if it wasn’t. GPT-5, by contrast, found a solution that worked every time: It simply took the actual index of each row (not the fictitious ‘index_value’) and added 1 to it in order to create new_column. This is the worst possible outcome: The code executes successfully, and at first glance seems to be doing the right thing, but the resulting value is essentially a random number. In a real-world example, this would create a much larger headache downstream in the code. df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’) df['new_column'] = df.index + 1 I wondered if this issue was particular to the gpt family of models. I didn’t test every model in existence, but as a check, I repeated my experiment on Anthropic’s Claude models. I found the same trend: The older Claude models, confronted with this unsolvable problem, essentially shrug their shoulders, while the newer models sometimes solve the problem and sometimes just sweep it under the rug. Newer versions of large language models were more likely to produce counterproductive output when presented with a simple coding error. Jamie Twiss Garbage in, garbage out I don’t have inside knowledge on why the newer models fail in such a pernicious way. But I have an educated guess. I believe it’s the result of how the LLMs are being trained to code. The older models were trained on code much the same way they were trained on other text. Large volumes of presumably functional code were ingested as training data, which was used to set model weights. This wasn’t always perfect, as anyone using AI for coding in early 2023 will remember, with frequent syntax errors and faulty logic. But it certainly didn’t rip out safety checks or find ways to create plausible but fake data, like GPT-5 in my example above. But as soon as AI coding assistants arrived and were integrated into coding environments, the model creators realized they had a powerful source of labeled training data: the behavior of the users themselves. If an assistant offered up suggested code, the code ran successfully, and the user accepted the code, that was a positive signal, a sign that the assistant had gotten it right. If the user rejected the code, or if the code failed to run, that was a negative signal, and when the model was retrained, the assistant would be steered in a different direction. This is a powerful idea, and no doubt contributed to the rapid improvement of AI coding assistants for a period of time. But as inexperienced coders started turning up in greater numbers, it also started to poison the training data. AI coding assistants that found ways to get their code accepted by users kept doing more of that, even if “that” meant turning off safety checks and generating plausible but useless data. As long as a suggestion was taken on board, it was viewed as good, and downstream pain would be unlikely to be traced back to the source. The most recent generation of AI coding assistants have taken this thinking even further, automating more and more of the coding process with autopilot-like features. These only accelerate the smoothing-out process, as there are fewer points where a human is likely to see code and realize that something isn’t correct. Instead, the assistant is likely to keep iterating to try to get to a successful execution. In doing so, it is likely learning the wrong lessons. I am a huge believer in artificial intelligence, and I believe that AI coding assistants have a valuable role to play in accelerating development and democratizing the process of software creation. But chasing short-term gains, and relying on cheap, abundant, but ultimately poor-quality training data is going to continue resulting in model outcomes that are worse than useless. To start making models better again, AI coding companies need to invest in high-quality data, perhaps even paying experts to label AI-generated code. Otherwise, the models will continue to produce garbage, be trained on that garbage, and thereby produce even more garbage, eating their own tails.",

          "summary": "Leaders of many organizations are urging their teams to adopt agentic AI to improve efficiency, but are finding it hard to achieve any benefit. Managers attempting to add AI agents to existing human teams may find that bots fail to faithfully follow their instructions, return pointless or obvious results or burn precious time and resources spinning on tasks that older, simpler systems could have accomplished just as well. The technical innovators getting the most out of AI are finding that the technology can be remarkably human in its behavior. And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge. Our research suggests that, because of how directly they seem to apply to hybrid teams of human and digital workers, the most effective leaders in the coming years may still be those who excel at understanding the timeworn principles of human management. We have spent years studying the risks and opportunities for organizations adopting AI. Our 2025 book, Rewiring Democracy, examines lessons from AI adoption in government institutions and civil society worldwide. In it, we identify where the technology has made the biggest impact and where it fails to make a difference. Today, we see many of the organizations we’ve studied taking another shot at AI adoption—this time, with agentic tools. While generative AI generates, agentic AI acts and achieves goals such as automating supply chain processes, making data-driven investment decisions or managing complex project workflows. The cutting edge of AI development research is starting to reveal what works best in this new paradigm. Understanding Agentic AI There are four key areas where AI should reliably boast superhuman performance: in speed, scale, scope and sophistication. Again and again, the most impactful AI applications leverage their capabilities in one or more of these areas. Think of content-moderation AI that can scan thousands of posts in an instant, legislative policy tools that can scale deliberations to millions of constituents, and protein-folding AI that can model molecular interactions with greater sophistication than any biophysicist. Equally, AI applications that don’t leverage these core capabilities typically fail to impress. For example, Google’s AI Overviews irritate many of its users when the overviews obscure information that could be more efficiently consumed straight from the web results that the AI attempted to synthesize. Agentic AI extends these core advantages of AI to new tasks and scenarios. The most familiar AI tools are chatbots, image generators and other models that take a single action: ask one question, get one answer. Agentic systems solve more complex problems by using many such AI models and giving each one the capability to use tools like retrieving information from databases and perform tasks like sending emails or executing financial transactions. Because agentic systems are so new and their potential configurations so vast, we are still learning which business processes they will fit well with and which they will not. Gartner has estimated that 40 per cent of agentic AI projects will be cancelled within two years, largely because they are targeted where they can’t achieve meaningful business impact. Understanding Agentic AI behavior To understand the collective behaviors of agentic AI systems, we need to examine the individual AIs that comprise them. When AIs make mistakes or make things up, they can behave in ways that are truly bizarre. But when they work well, the reasons why are sometimes surprisingly relatable. Tools like ChatGPT drew attention by sounding human. Moreover, individual AIs often behave like individual people, responding to incentives and organizing their own work in much the same ways that humans do. Recall the counterintuitive findings of many early users of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) in 2022: They seemed to perform better when offered a cash tip, told the answer was really important or were threatened with hypothetical punishments. One of the most effective and enduring techniques discovered in those early days of LLM testing was ‘chain-of-thought prompting,’ which instructed AIs to think through and explain each step of their analysis—much like a teacher forcing a student to show their work. Individual AIs can also react to new information similar to individual people. Researchers have found that LLMs can be effective at simulating the opinions of individual people or demographic groups on diverse topics, including consumer preferences and politics. As agentic AI develops, we are finding that groups of AIs also exhibit human-like behaviors collectively. A 2025 paper found that communities of thousands of AI agents set to chat with each other developed familiar human social behaviors like settling into echo chambers. Other researchers have observed the emergence of cooperative and competitive strategies and the development of distinct behavioral roles when setting groups of AIs to play a game together. The fact that groups of agentic AIs are working more like human teams doesn’t necessarily indicate that machines have inherently human-like characteristics. It may be more nurture than nature: AIs are being designed with inspiration from humans. The breakthrough triumph of ChatGPT was widely attributed to using human feedback during training. Since then, AI developers have gotten better at aligning AI models to human expectations. It stands to reason, then, that we may find similarities between the management techniques that work for human workers and for agentic AI. Lessons From the Frontier So, how best to manage hybrid teams of humans and agentic AIs? Lessons can be gleaned from leading AI labs. In a recent research report, Anthropic shared the practical roadmap and published lessons learned while building its Claude Research feature, which uses teams of multiple AI agents to accomplish complex reasoning tasks. For example, using agents to search the web for information and calling external tools to access information from sources like emails and documents. Advancements in agentic AI enabling new offerings like Claude Research and Amazon Q are causing a stir among AI practitioners because they reveal insights from the frontlines of AI research about how to make agentic AI and the hybrid organizations that leverage it more effective. What is striking about Anthropic’s report is how transparent it is about all the hard-won lessons learned in developing its offering—and the fact that many of these lessons sound a lot like what we find in classic management texts: LESSON 1: DELEGATION MATTERS. When Anthropic analyzed what factors lead to excellent performance by Claude Research, it turned out that the best agentic systems weren’t necessarily built on the best or most expensive AI models. Rather, like a good human manager, they need to excel at breaking down and distributing tasks to their digital workers. Unlike human teams, agentic systems can enlist as many AI workers as needed, onboard them instantly and immediately set them to work. Organizations that can exploit this scalability property of AI will gain a key advantage, but the hard part is assigning each of them to contribute meaningful, complementary work to the overall project. In classical management, this is called delegation. Any good manager knows that, even if they have the most experience and the strongest skills of anyone on their team, they can’t do it all alone. Delegation is necessary to harness the collective capacity of their team. It turns out this is crucial to AI, too. The authors explain this result in terms of ‘parallelization’: Being able to separate the work into small chunks allows many AI agents to contribute work simultaneously, each focusing on one piece of the problem. The research report attributes 80 per cent of the performance differences between agentic AI systems to the total amount of computing resources they leverage. Whether or not each individual agent is the smartest in the digital toolbox, the collective has more capacity for reasoning when there are many AI ‘hands’ working together. In addition to the quality of the output, teams working in parallel get work done faster. Anthropic says that reconfiguring its AI agents to work in parallel improved research speed by 90 per cent. Anthropic’s report on how to orchestrate agentic systems effectively reads like a classical delegation training manual: Provide a clear objective, specify the output you expect and provide guidance on what tools to use, and set boundaries. When the objective and output format is not clear, workers may come back with irrelevant or irreconcilable information. LESSON 2: ITERATION MATTERS. Edison famously tested thousands of light bulb designs and filament materials before arriving at a workable solution. Likewise, successful agentic AI systems work far better when they are allowed to learn from their early attempts and then try again. Claude Research spawns a multitude of AI agents, each doubling and tripling back on their own work as they go through a trial-and-error process to land on the right results. This is exactly how management researchers have recommended organizations staff novel projects where large teams are tasked with exploring unfamiliar terrain: Teams should split up and conduct trial-and-error learning, in parallel, like a pharmaceutical company progressing multiple molecules towards a potential clinical trial. Even when one candidate seems to have the strongest chances at the outset, there is no telling in advance which one will improve the most as it is iterated upon. The advantage of using AI for this iterative process is speed: AI agents can complete and retry their tasks in milliseconds. A recent report from Microsoft Research illustrates this. Its agentic AI system launched up to five AI worker teams in a race to finish a task first, each plotting and pursuing its own iterative path to the destination. They found that a five-team system typically returned results about twice as fast as a single AI worker team with no loss in effectiveness, although at the cost of about twice as much total computing spend. Going further, Claude Research’s system design endowed its top-level AI agent—the ‘Lead Researcher’—with the decision authority to delegate more research iterations if it was not satisfied with the results returned by its sub-agents. They managed the choice of whether or not they should continue their iterative search loop, to a limit. To the extent that agentic AI mirrors the world of human management, this might be one of the most important topics to watch going forward. Deciding when to stop and what is ‘good enough’ has always been one of the hardest problems organizations face. LESSON 3: EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SHARING MATTERS. If you work in a manufacturing department, you wouldn’t rely on your division chief to explain the specs you need to meet for a new product. You would go straight to the source: the domain experts in R&D. Successful organizations need to be able to share complex information efficiently both vertically and horizontally. To solve the horizontal sharing problem for Claude Research, Anthropic innovated a novel mechanism for AI agents to share their outputs directly with each other by writing directly to a common file system, like a corporate intranet. In addition to saving on the cost of the central coordinator having to consume every sub-agent’s output, this approach helps resolve the information bottleneck. It enables AI agents that have become specialized in their tasks to own how their content is presented to the larger digital team. This is a smart way to leverage the superhuman scope of AI workers, enabling each of many AI agents to act as distinct subject matter experts. In effect, Anthropic’s AI Lead Researchers must be generalist managers. Their job is to see the big picture and translate that into the guidance that sub-agents need to do their work. They don’t need to be experts on every task the sub-agents are performing. The parallel goes further: AIs working together also need to know the limits of information sharing, like what kinds of tasks don’t make sense to distribute horizontally. Management scholars suggest that human organizations focus on automating the smallest tasks; the ones that are most repeatable and that can be executed the most independently. Tasks that require more interaction between people tend to go slower, since the communication not only adds overhead, but is something that many struggle to do effectively. Anthropic found much the same was true of its AI agents: “Domains that require all agents to share the same context or involve many dependencies between agents are not a good fit for multi-agent systems today.” This is why the company focused its premier agentic AI feature on research, a process that can leverage a large number of sub-agents each performing repetitive, isolated searches before compiling and synthesizing the results. All of these lessons lead to the conclusion that knowing your team and paying keen attention to how to get the best out of them will continue to be the most important skill of successful managers of both humans and AIs. With humans, we call this leadership skill empathy. That concept doesn’t apply to AIs, but the techniques of empathic managers do. Anthropic got the most out of its AI agents by performing a thoughtful, systematic analysis of their performance and what supports they benefited from, and then used that insight to optimize how they execute as a team. Claude Research is designed to put different AI models in the positions where they are most likely to succeed. Anthropic’s most intelligent Opus model takes the Lead Researcher role, while their cheaper and faster Sonnet model fulfills the more numerous sub-agent roles. Anthropic has analyzed how to distribute responsibility and share information across its digital worker network. And it knows that the next generation of AI models might work in importantly different ways, so it has built performance measurement and management systems that help it tune its organizational architecture to adapt to the characteristics of its AI ‘workers.’ Key Takeaways Managers of hybrid teams can apply these ideas to design their own complex systems of human and digital workers: DELEGATE. Analyze the tasks in your workflows so that you can design a division of labour that plays to the strength of each of your resources. Entrust your most experienced humans with the roles that require context and judgment and entrust AI models with the tasks that need to be done quickly or benefit from extreme parallelization. If you’re building a hybrid customer service organization, let AIs handle tasks like eliciting pertinent information from customers and suggesting common solutions. But always escalate to human representatives to resolve unique situations and offer accommodations, especially when doing so can carry legal obligations and financial ramifications. To help them work together well, task the AI agents with preparing concise briefs compiling the case history and potential resolutions to help humans jump into the conversation. ITERATE. AIs will likely underperform your top human team members when it comes to solving novel problems in the fields in which they are expert. But AI agents’ speed and parallelization still make them valuable partners. Look for ways to augment human-led explorations of new territory with agentic AI scouting teams that can explore many paths for them in advance. Hybrid software development teams will especially benefit from this strategy. Agentic coding AI systems are capable of building apps, autonomously making improvements to and bug-fixing their code to meet a spec. But without humans in the loop, they can fall into rabbit holes. Examples abound of AI-generated code that might appear to satisfy specified requirements, but diverges from products that meet organizational requirements for security, integration or user experiences that humans would truly desire. Take advantage of the fast iteration of AI programmers to test different solutions, but make sure your human team is checking its work and redirecting the AI when needed. SHARE. Make sure each of your hybrid team’s outputs are accessible to each other so that they can benefit from each others’ work products. Make sure workers doing hand-offs write down clear instructions with enough context that either a human colleague or AI model could follow. Anthropic found that AI teams benefited from clearly communicating their work to each other, and the same will be true of communication between humans and AI in hybrid teams. MEASURE AND IMPROVE. Organizations should always strive to grow the capabilities of their human team members over time. Assume that the capabilities and behaviors of your AI team members will change over time, too, but at a much faster rate. So will the ways the humans and AIs interact together. Make sure to understand how they are performing individually and together at the task level, and plan to experiment with the roles you ask AI workers to take on as the technology evolves. An important example of this comes from medical imaging. Harvard Medical School researchers have found that hybrid AI-physician teams have wildly varying performance as diagnosticians. The problem wasn’t necessarily that the AI has poor or inconsistent performance; what mattered was the interaction between person and machine. Different doctors’ diagnostic performance benefited—or suffered—at different levels when they used AI tools. Being able to measure and optimize those interactions, perhaps at the individual level, will be critical to hybrid organizations. In Closing We are in a phase of AI technology where the best performance is going to come from mixed teams of humans and AIs working together. Managing those teams is not going to be the same as we’ve grown used to, but the hard-won lessons of decades past still have a lot to offer. This essay was written with Nathan E.

        "summary_markdown": "- The AI data center construction boom continues unabated, with the demand for power in the United States potentially reaching 106 gigawatts by 2035, according to a December report from research and analysis company BloombergNEF. That’s a 36 percent jump from the company’s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and—perhaps most significantly—a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust. The power grid engineering workforce is currently shrinking, and data center operators are also hurting for trained electrical engineers. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for Applied Digital, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter. “As we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,” says Laltrello. “We are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn’t have to come from a data center background.” Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management’s (AFCOM) State of the Data Center Report 2025, 58 percent of data center managers identified multi-skilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need. Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost 400,000 more construction workers by 2033. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing and HVAC, and roughly 17,500 electrical and electronics engineers. These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers. “The challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,” says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm Apolo. “Data centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool and AI is amplifying this pressure.” Data center developers like Lancium and construction firms like Crusoe face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they’re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October of 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power. Michael McNamara, the CEO of Lancium, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require one gigawatt of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less. That kind of ramp up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) integration, says Matthew Hawkins, the director of education for Uptime Institute. “Demand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,” says Hawkins. Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering’s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco. “Technical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,” says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM. Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft’s Datacenter Academy is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. Google supports local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and Amazon offers data center apprenticeships. The Siemens Educates America program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations. The company has committed to training 200,000 electricians and electrical manufacturing workers by 2030. Similarly, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) operates the Electrical Training Alliance; the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) offers ToolingU-SME, aimed at expanding the manufacturing workforce; and Uptime Institute Education programs look to accelerate the readiness of technicians and operators. “Every university we speak with is thinking about this challenge and shifting its curriculum to prepare students for the future of digital infrastructure,” said Laltrello. “The best way to predict the future is to build it.”",

Bonta’s office demands that xAI immediately cease and desist from creating “digitized sexually explicit material” when the depicted individual didn’t consent to it or if the individual is a minor. It also demanded that xAI stop “facilitating or aiding and abetting the creation… or publication of digitized sexually explicit material” of nonconsenting individuals and persons under 18 years of age. X changed its policies after the issue broke out and prevented the Grok account from being able to edit images of real people into revealing clothing. xAI also moved Grok’s image-generating features behind a paywall and geoblocked paying users’ ability to edit images of real people into bikinis, but only in regions where it’s illegal. In his announcement, Bonta said xAI developed a “spicy mode” for Grok to generate explicit content and used it as a marketing point. The California AG also said that Grok-generated sexual images are being used to harass both public figures and ordinary users. “Most alarmingly, news reports have described the use of Grok to alter images of children to depict them in minimal clothing and sexual situations,” Bonta’s announcement reads. “The actions above violate California law, including California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200,” it said. The state’s Department of Justice now expects to hear from xAI on the steps it’s taking to address these issues within the next five days. xAI has been producing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images used to harass women & girls across the internet.

It reportedly continues to produce “nudified” deepfakes of real people. And now, Ashley St. Clair, a conservative political strategist and mother of one of Elon Musk’s 14 children, has sued xAI for nonconsensual sexualized images of her that Grok allegedly produced. In the court filing, St. Clair accused xAI’s Grok chatbot of creating and disseminating deepfakes of her “as a child stripped down to a string bikini, and as an adult in sexually explicit poses, covered in semen, or wearing only bikini floss.” In some cases, the chatbot allegedly produced bikini-clad deepfakes of St. Clair based on a photo of her as a 14-year-old. “People took pictures of me as a child and undressed me. There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over, and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now,” she said. “I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated,” St. Clair told The Guardian. “These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet, and now it is on a mainstream social media app.” St. Clair said that, after she reported the images to X, the social platform replied that the content didn’t violate any policies. In addition, she claims that X left the images posted for up to seven days after she reported them. St. Clair said xAI then retaliated against her by creating more digitally undressed deepfakes of her, therefore “making [St. Clair] the laughingstock of the social media platform.” She accused the company of then revoking her X Premium subscription, verification checkmark and ability to monetize content on the platform. “xAI further banned [her] from repurchasing Premium,” St. Clair’s court filing states. On Wednesday, X said it changed its policies so that Grok would no longer generate sexualized images of children or nonconsensual nudity “in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal.” However, the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to undress and sexualize photos when prompted to do so. Neither Apple nor Google has removed the Grok app despite explicit policy violations. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Apple and Google have thus far done, well, absolutely nothing. Despite the multi-week outrage over the deepfakes — and an open letter from 28 advocacy groups — neither company has removed the X or Grok apps from their app stores. Both the App Store and Play Store have policies that explicitly prohibit apps that generate such content. Neither Apple nor Google has responded to multiple requests for comment from Engadget. That includes a follow-up email sent on Friday, regarding the Grok app continuing to “nudify” photos of real women and other people. While Apple and Google fail to act, many governments have done the opposite. On Monday, Malaysia and Indonesia banned Grok. The same day, UK regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X. California opened one on Wednesday. The US Senate even passed the Defiance Act for a second time in the wake of the blowback. “If you are a woman, you can’t post a picture, and you can’t speak, or you risk this abuse,” St. Clair told The Guardian. “It’s dangerous, and I believe this is by design. You are supposed to feed AI humanity and thoughts, and when you are doing things that particularly impact women, and they don’t want to participate in it because they are being targeted, it means the AI is inherently going to be biased.” Speaking about Musk and his team, she added that “these people believe they are above the law, because they are. They don’t think they are going to get in trouble, they think they have no consequences.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-mother-of-one-of-elon-musks-children-is-suing-xai-over-nonconsensual-deepfake-images-191451979.html?src=rss",

Bonta’s office demands that xAI immediately cease and desist from creating “digitized sexually explicit material” when the depicted individual didn’t consent to it or if the individual is a minor. It also demanded that xAI stop “facilitating or aiding and abetting the creation… or publication of digitized sexually explicit material” of nonconsenting individuals and persons under 18 years of age. X changed its policies after the issue broke out and prevented the Grok account from being able to edit images of real people into revealing clothing. xAI also moved Grok’s image-generating features behind a paywall and geoblocked paying users’ ability to edit images of real people into bikinis, but only in regions where it’s illegal. In his announcement, Bonta said xAI developed a “spicy mode” for Grok to generate explicit content and used it as a marketing point. The California AG also said that Grok-generated sexual images are being used to harass both public figures and ordinary users. “Most alarmingly, news reports have described the use of Grok to alter images of children to depict them in minimal clothing and sexual situations,” Bonta’s announcement reads. “The actions above violate California law, including California Civil Code section 1708.86, California Penal Code sections 311 et seq. and 647(j)(4), and California Business & Professions Code section 17200,” it said. The state’s Department of Justice now expects to hear from xAI on the steps it’s taking to address these issues within the next five days. xAI has been producing deepfake nonconsensual intimate images used to harass women & girls across the internet.

          "summary": "- Development of Apple's rumored OLED MacBook Pro took another forward step this month when the next-generation production line responsible for manufacturing its displays commenced operation. Samsung Display is expected to make the panels for Apple's MacBook Pro, and has invested heavily in an 8.6-generation OLED production line located at its Asan campus in South Korea. An 8.6G fab uses much larger glass substrates than the OLED lines used for smartphones, which allows multiple laptop-sized panels to be cut from a single sheet. This improves yields and lowers costs, which is just what Apple needs if OLED is to replace mini-LED in the MacBook Pro. The line is designed around rigid OLED panels with oxide TFT backplanes and advanced tandem OLED structures. These are better suited to laptops, and offer higher brightness, improved power efficiency, and longer lifespan compared with conventional single-stack OLED panels. yeux1122 on the Naver blog, Samsung has now begun producing panels from the line, suggesting Apple and other customers have completed qualification and reliability testing. analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The claim has been corroborated by Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, who also said the laptops will have \"thinner and lighter frames.\" Apple is apparently focusing on delivering the thinnest possible device without compromising on battery life or major new features. The redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are also expected to have a hole-punch camera at the top of the display, and it could potentially be housed in a pill-shaped cutout similar to the iPhone's Dynamic Island, rather than the notch MacBook Pro owners are accustomed to. late 2026 or early 2027 launch, following the expected introduction of 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in the next month or so.

          "summary": "- Apple's foldable iPhone will share the same next-generation A20 Pro chip as the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max models when it debuts this September, according to industry analyst Jeff Pu. In his latest investor note, Pu outlined the projected specifications for all three premium devices that will take center stage this fall, with the regular iPhone 18 and more affordable iPhone 18e models not expected to debut until spring 2027 as part of Apple's new split-launch strategy. Powered by the A20 Pro chip, the iPhone Fold and iPhone 18 Pro models will showcase TSMC's new 2nm process, N2, boasting performance improvements that could be up to 15 percent faster and 30 percent more efficient than A19 chips. Moreover, the A20 Pro chips will be packaged with TSMC's Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology. With WMCM, the chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafter as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than the RAM being adjacent to the chip and connected via silicon interposer. rumored previously. N2 also introduces new super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal (SHPMIM) capacitors into the chip's power delivery system. These capacitors more than double the capacitance density of the previous generation and reduce both sheet resistance and via resistance by 50 percent.

          "summary": "- Apple's Sainte-Catherine store in Montréal, Canada has a new home at the northeast corner of Rue Saint-Catherine and Rue de la Montagne. The location officially opened to the public today, and the first people who visited received a complimentary tote bag and toque (the Canadian term for what Americans call a beanie), the latter of which will come in handy given Montréal's temperature is currently hovering around -15ºC (5ºF). The store spans the first floor of a historic building that was extensively renovated for Apple. The second and third floors are not accessible to customers. The new space is more than double the size of Apple's original location on Rue Saint-Catherine, which is now permanently closed. There are side-by-side counters for the Genius Bar and Apple Pickup, where customers can receive technical support and collect items they ordered through Apple's online store, respectively. Photo Credit: Tomy The interior design of the store is familiar, but there are a few unique elements, including the entrance and a curved wood ceiling. Apple says the store's façade blends historic Saint-Marc stone from Québec with local granite, while local copper artisans extensively restored the cornice that tops the building. on its website. At the store, customers who make a purchase can receive a complimentary Apple Store shopping bag with an illustration by Montréal-based artist Catherine Potvin this Saturday, January 17, between 1:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time.

          "title": "Anthropic launches Claude Cowork, a version of its coding AI for regular people",
          "summary": "- If you follow Anthropic, you're probably familiar with Claude Code. Since the fall of 2024, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called Claude Cowork. The company is billing Cowork as \"a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.\" After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that's easier to parse at a glance. Another example: you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install Claude’s Chrome plugin — and make can use Anthropic's Connectors framework to access third-party apps like Canva. \"Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,\" the company said. \"Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.\" If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude \"can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.\" However, the company does note the system can \"take potentially destructive actions,\" such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it's best to give \"very clear\" guidance to Claude. Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite seemingly limited adoption. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier. Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey Claude Max subscription. That changed on Friday when the company expanded access to include customers of its $20 per month Pro plan. If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you'll need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. Update 01/16/26 2:30PM ET: Updated to reflect Claude Cowork is now also available to Claude Pro customers.

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion. ICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA Enjoy today’s videos! This is one of the best things I have ever seen. [ Kinetic Intelligent Machine LAB ] After years of aggressive testing and pushing the envelope with U.S. Army and Marine Corps partners, the Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program approaches its conclusion. But the impact of RACER will reverberate far beyond the program’s official end date, leaving a legacy of robust autonomous capabilities ready to transform military operations and inspire a new wave of private-sector investment. [ DARPA ] Best-looking humanoid yet. [ Kawasaki ] COSA (Cognitive OS of Agents) is a physical-world-native Agentic OS that unifies high-level cognition with whole-body motion control, enabling humanoid robots to think while acting in real environments. Powered by COSA, Oli becomes the first humanoid agent with both advanced loco-manipulation and high-level autonomous cognition. [ LimX Dynamics ] Thanks, Jinyan! The 1X World Model’s latest update is a paradigm shift in robot learning: NEO now uses a physics-grounded video model (World Model) to turn any voice or text prompt into fully autonomous action, even for completely novel tasks and objects NEO has never seen before. By leveraging internet-scale video data fine-tuned on real robot experience, NEO can visualize future actions, predict outcomes, and execute them with humanlike understanding–all without prior examples. This marks the critical first step in NEO being able to collect data on its own to master new tasks all by itself. [ 1X ] I’m impressed by the human who was mocapped for this. [ PNDbotics ] We introduce the GuideData Dataset, a collection of qualitative data, focusing on the interactions between guide dog trainers, visually impaired (BLV) individuals, and their guide dogs. The dataset captures a variety of real-world scenarios, including navigating sidewalks, climbing stairs, crossing streets, and avoiding obstacles. By providing this comprehensive dataset, the project aims to advance research in areas such as assistive technologies, robotics, and human-robot interaction, ultimately improving the mobility and safety of visually impaired people. [ DARoS Lab ] Fourier’s desktop Care-Bot prototype is gaining much attention at CES 2026! Even though it’s still in the prototype stage, we couldn’t wait to share these adorable and fun interaction features with you. [ Fourier ] Volcanic gas measurements are critical for understanding eruptive activity. However, harsh terrain, hazardous conditions, and logistical constraints make near-surface data collection extremely challenging. In this work, we present an autonomous legged robotic system for volcanic gas monitoring, validated through real-world deployments on Mount Etna. The system combines a quadruped robot equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a modular autonomy stack, enabling long-distance missions in rough volcanic terrain. [ ETH Zurich RSL ] Humanoid and Siemens successfully completed a POC testing humanoid robots in industrial logistics. This is the first step in the broader partnership between the companies. The POC focused on a tote-to-conveyor destacking task within Siemens’s logistics process. HMND 01 autonomously picked, transported, and placed totes in a live production environment during a two-week on-site deployment at the Siemens Electronics Factory in Erlangen. [ Humanoid ] Four Growers, a category leader in intelligent ag-tech platforms, developed the GR-200 robotic harvesting platform, powered by FANUC’s LR Mate robot. The system combines AI-driven vision and motion planning to identify and harvest ripe tomatoes with quick precision. [ FANUC ] Columbia Engineers built a robot that, for the first time, is able to learn facial lip motions for tasks such as speech and singing. In a new study published in Science Robotics, the researchers demonstrate how their robot used its abilities to articulate words in a variety of languages, and even sing a song out of its AI-generated debut album, “hello world_.” The robot acquired this ability through observational learning rather than via rules. It first learned how to use its 26 facial motors by watching its own reflection in the mirror before learning to imitate human lip motion by watching hours of YouTube videos. [ Columbia ] Roborock has some odd ideas about what lawns are like. [ Roborock ] DEEP Robotics’ quadruped robots demonstrate coordinated multi-module operations under unified command, tackling complex and dynamic firefighting scenarios with agility and precision. [ DEEP Robotics ] Unlike statically stable wheeled platforms, humanoids are dynamically stable, requiring continuous active control to maintain balance and prevent falls. This inherent instability presents a critical challenge for functional safety, particularly in collaborative settings. This presentation will introduce Synapticon’s POSITRON platform, a comprehensive solution engineered to address these safety-critical demands. We will explore how its integrated hardware and software enable robust, certifiable safety functions that meet the highest industrial standards, providing key insights into making the next generation of humanoid robots safe for real-world deployment. [ Synapticon ] The University of California, Berkeley, is world-famous for its AI developments, and one big name behind them is Ken Goldberg. Longtime professor and lifelong artist, Ken is all about deep learning while staying true to “good old-fashioned engineering.” Hear Ken talk about his approach to vision and touch for robotic surgeries and how robots will evolve across the board.

          "summary": "Video Friday is your weekly selection of awesome robotics videos, collected by your friends at IEEE Spectrum robotics. We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion. ICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA Enjoy today’s videos! We’re excited to announce the product version of our Atlas® robot. This enterprise-grade humanoid robot offers impressive strength and range of motion, precise manipulation, and intelligent adaptability—designed to power the new industrial revolution. [ Boston Dynamics ] I appreciate the creativity and technical innovation here, but realistically, if you’ve got more than one floor in your house? Just get a second robot. That single-step sunken living room though.... [ Roborock ] Wow, SwitchBot’s CES 2026 video shows almost as many robots in their fantasy home as I have in my real home. [ SwitchBot ] What is happening in robotics right now that I can derive more satisfaction from watching robotic process automation than I can from watching yet another humanoid video? [ ABB ] Yes, this is definitely a robot I want in close proximity to my life. [ Unitree ] The video below demonstrates a MenteeBot learning, through mentoring, how to replace a battery in another MenteeBot. No teleoperation is used. [ Mentee Robotics ] Personally, I think we should encourage humanoid robots to fall much more often, just so we can see whether they can get up again. [ Agility Robotics ] Achieving long-horizon, reliable clothing manipulation in the real world remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics. This live test demonstrates a strong step forward in embodied intelligence, vision-language-action systems, and real-world robotic autonomy. [ HKU MMLab ] Millions of people around the world need assistance with feeding. Robotic feeding systems offer the potential to enhance autonomy and quality of life for individuals with impairments and reduce caregiver workload. However, their widespread adoption has been limited by technical challenges such as estimating bite timing, the appropriate moment for the robot to transfer food to a user’s mouth. In this work, we introduce WAFFLE: Wearable Approach For Feeding with LEarned Bite Timing, a system that accurately predicts bite timing by leveraging wearable sensor data to be highly reactive to natural user cues such as head movements, chewing, and talking. [ CMU RCHI ] Humanoid robots are now available as platforms, which is a great way of sidestepping the whole practicality question. [ PNDbotics ] We’re introducing Spatially Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs)—a simple yet powerful modification that enables robots to build implicit spatial memories for navigation. Published in the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), this work demonstrates up to +105 percent improvement over baseline approaches, with robots successfully navigating 70+ meters in the real world using only a single forward-facing camera. [ ETHZ RSL ] Looking forward to the DARPA Triage Challenge this fall! [ DARPA ] Here are a couple of good interviews from the Humanoids Summit 2025. [ Humanoids Summit ]",

          "summary": "In a few days, Las Vegas will be inundated with engineers, executives, investors, and members of the press—including me—for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, one of the largest tech events of the year. If you can dream it, there’s a good chance it’ll be on display at CES 2026 (though admittedly, much of this tech won’t necessarily make it to the mainstream). There will be a range of AI toys, AI notetakers, and “AI companions,” exoskeletons and humanoid robots, and health tech to track your hormones, brain activity, and... bathroom activity. This year’s event will have keynote addresses from the CEOs of tech giants including AMD and Lenovo, and thousands of booths from companies spanning legacy brands to brand-new startups. I’m excited to stumble across unexpected new tech while wandering the show floor. But as I prepare for this year’s event, here are some of the devices that have already caught my eye. Headphones that can read your brainwaves Electroencephalography, or EEG, has been used in health care for decades to monitor neural activity. It usually involves a person wearing a whole helmet of electrodes, but scaled-down versions of the tech are now being integrated into consumer devices and may soon be ready for users. Several neurotech companies using EEG will be at CES this year. For instance, Neurable (a company we’ve had on our radar for years) is announcing a new headset with gaming brand HyperX, which is meant to help players hone their focus by tracking brain activity in real time. Neurable’s over-ear EEG headphones for everyday use are now available for preorder. Naox will also bring its in-ear EEG tech to consumer-oriented earbuds. And Elemind, another company we’ve covered, aims to help you sleep with its headband. With wearables already monitoring vital signs, sleep, and activity, 2026 may be the year our brainwaves join the list of biosignals we can track on a daily basis. A toothbrush to sniff out health issues Sonic toothbrush company Y-Brush is introducing dental tech analyzing another biomarker: smelly breath. The toothbrush itself is y-shaped and looks almost like a dental retainer on a stick, with bristles surrounding the teeth. In the latest version, the Y-Brush Halo, a gas sensor called SmartNose is integrated to analyze breath biomarkers. The company says this allows the toothbrush to detect more than 300 health conditions, including early-stage diabetes and liver disorders. Automatic massage roller to sooth sore muscles RheoFit’s A1 massage roller basically looks like what would happen if a foam roller and a massage chair had a baby. The device automatically rolls itself down your spine and offers two replaceable surfaces: one harder material that mimics a masseuse’s knuckles, and a gentler option that’s meant to feel more like an open palm. This will be the second year the RheoFit A1 is on display. To find out whether it’s worth the US $449 price tag, I’ll have to try it out on site. Minimalist e-ink smartphone to cut out distractions Just before last year’s CES, several devices were awarded a new certification meant to reward tech designed to be less distracting. While most exhibitors will keep competing for our attention, a few are tapping into a desire for calm and clarity. Minimalist tech company Mudita, for instance, will be showing its e-ink smartphone, which began shipping in 2025. The phone is designed to reduce screen time with its black-and-white, paperlike display, and the operating system is designed to run without Google. Like other not-as-smart phones (such as the Wisephone or Light Phone), the Mudita Kompakt offers the essentials—messaging, maps, camera, and so forth—without constant notifications. Food allergen detector to avoid anaphylaxis Some new tech surprises users with an experience they didn’t know they wanted. Others aim to offer the solutions you’ve dreamt about. For me, French startup Allergen Alert falls into the second category. The startup, one of the listed exhibitors at an early press event on 4 January, is developing a portable system to test food allergens in real time. I’ve been eating gluten-free for most of my life (not by choice), and I know how easily allergens can sneak into a dish with just a sprinkle of flour, or a dash of soy sauce—especially when you’re traveling or eating out. For many people with severe allergies, a device like this could be a lifesaver. This story was updated on 5 January, 2026 to add that Neurable announced a new headset with HyperX. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the company was displaying its MW75 Neuro at CES. This has been removed.",

I always love seeing robots progress from research projects to commercial products. [ Ground Control Robotics ] Well this has to be one of the most “watch a robot do this task entirely through the magic of jump cuts” I’ve ever seen. [ UBTECH ] Very satisfying sound on this one. [ Pudu Robotics ] Welcome to the AgileX Robotics Data Collection Facility, where real robots build the foundation for universal embodied intelligence. Our core mission? Enable large-scale data sharing and reuse across dual-arm teleoperation robots of diverse morphologies, breaking down data silos that slow down AI progress. [ AgileX ] I’m not sure how much thought was put into this, but giving a service robot an explicit cat face could be a good way of moderating expectations on its behavior and interactivity. [ Pudu Robotics ] UBTECH says they have built 1,000 of their Walker S2 humanoid robots, over 500 of which are “delivered & working.” I would very much like to know what “working” means in this context. [ UBTECH ] Every story has its beginning, and ours started in 2023—a year defined by the unknown. Let technology return to passion; let trials catalyze evolution. Embracing growth, embarking on a new journey. We’ll see you at the next stop. Please, please hire someone to do some HRI (human-robot interface) design. [ PNDbotics ]",

          "summary": "Every September as we plan our January tech forecast issue, IEEE Spectrum’s editors survey their beats and seek out promising projects that could solve seemingly intractable problems or transform entire industries. Often these projects fly under the radar of the popular technology press, which these days seems more interested in the personalities driving Big Tech companies than in the technology itself. We go our own way here, getting out into the field to bring you news of the hidden gems that genuinely—as the IEEE motto goes—advance technology for the benefit of humanity. A look back at the last 20 years of January issues reveals that while we’ve certainly covered our share of huge tech projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope, many of the stories touch on subjects most people would have otherwise missed. Last January, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz reported on startups that are piloting ocean-based carbon capture. This issue, she’s back with another CO2-centric story, this time focused on grid-scale storage, which is poised to blow up—literally. Waltz traveled to Sardinia to check out Milan-based Energy Dome’s “bubble battery,” which can store up to 200 megawatt-hours by compressing and decompressing pure carbon dioxide inside an inflatable dome. This kind of modular, easy-to-deploy energy storage could be especially useful for AI data centers, says Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, who curated this issue and wrote about gravity energy storage back in January 2021. Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquefy cancer tumors. “When we think about energy storage, our minds usually go to grid-scale batteries,” Moore says. “Yet these bubbles, which are in many ways more capable than batteries, will be sprouting up all over the place, often in association with computing infrastructure.” For his story in this issue, Moore dove into the competition between two startups that are developing radio-based cables to replace conventional copper cables and fiber optics in data centers. These radio systems can connect processors 10 to 20 meters apart using a third of the power of optical-fiber cables and at a third of the cost. The next step is to integrate the radio connections directly with GPUs, to ease cooling burdens and help data centers and the AI models running on them continue to scale up. Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquify cancer tumors, as Greg Uyeno found when reporting on HistoSonics’ ultrasound treatment. Feared for its aggressive nature and extremely low survival rate, pancreatic cancer kills almost half a million people per year worldwide. HistoSonics uses noninvasive, focused ultrasound to create cavitation bubbles that destroy tumors without dangerously heating surrounding tissue. This year, the company is concluding kidney trials as well as launching pancreatic cancer trials. Over the last two decades, Spectrum has regularly covered the rise of drones. In 2018, for instance, we reported that the startup Zipline would deploy autonomous drones to deliver blood and medical supplies in rural Rwanda. Today, Zipline has a market cap of about US $4 billion and operates in several African countries, Japan, and the United States, having completed almost 2 million drone deliveries. In this issue, journalist Robb Mandelbaum takes us inside the Wildfire XPrize competition, aimed at providing another life-saving service: dousing wildfires before they grow out of control. Zipline succeeded because it could make deliveries to remote locations much faster than land vehicles. This year’s XPrize teams plan to detect and suppress fires faster than conventional firefighting methods. In addition to these emerging technologies, we’ve packed this issue with a dozen others, including Porsche’s wireless home charger for EVs, the world’s first electric air taxi service, neutral-atom quantum computers, interoperable mesh networks, and robotic baseball umpires. Let’s see which of this year’s picks make it to the big leagues.",

According to a detailed report published by semiconductor analyst Tim Culpan on his blog Culpium, Apple is no longer guaranteed preferential access to leading-edge manufacturing capacity at TSMC, marking a notable change after more than a decade in which Apple's chips were central to the foundry's expansion strategy. Apple is now competing directly with AI-focused customers such as Nvidia and AMD for supply, particularly at the most advanced process nodes. AI accelerators consume substantially more wafer area per unit than smartphone system-on-chips, meaning that even a smaller number of AI customers can absorb a disproportionate share of advanced manufacturing output. As a result, Apple's chip designs are no longer automatically prioritized across TSMC's two dozen fabrication plants. Nvidia likely surpassed Apple as TSMC's largest customer by revenue in at least one or two quarters in 2025, but exact customer rankings are unknown.

The workers were sacked a week before a vote was scheduled to establish a collective bargaining unit. The moderators said they wanted better protection against the personal toll of processing traumatic content at a high speed. They accused TikTok of unfair dismissal and violating UK trade union laws. \"Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet,\" John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union (CWU), said in a statement to The Guardian. \"They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use.

The company said 91 percent of transgressive content is now removed automatically. The company first announced a restructuring exercise in August, just as hundreds of moderators in TikTok's London offices were organizing for union recognition.

          "title": "How to claim Verizon's $20 credit for Wednesday's service outage",
          "summary": "- Verizon is offering a very small mea culpa after Wednesday's massive outage, which drew more than 1.5 million reports on Downdetector and lasted hours. Initially, the carrier posted on X that it will offer a $20 credit, but customers must redeem it in the myVerizon app. The company then said the credit could be claimed though customer service (via phone or chat), but our editors’ attempts to do so via chat were met with a message to wait for a text with further instructions. Engadget editors began receiving the texts this morning (Jan 16) with a link to redeem. From there, you need to log into your account and visit the Account Overview section. Up top, there should be a Take Action or Mobile Actions button with a red notification circle. Click that and you’ll see a pop-up about the credit and a Redeem Now button. After you click that, you’re done, and Verizon says you should see the credit in one or two billing cycles. Of course, you’ll want to keep an eye out that it actually happens and contact the company if it doesn’t show up. \"This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can,\" the company wrote. \"But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us.\" Incensed customers have largely replied with incredulity, both at the miniscule amount, and that it isn't being applied automatically. The entire redemption process takes a few clicks and about a minute to complete, which makes it even more frustrating that it can’t be automatically applied to every customer’s bill. Update, January 15 2026, 11:57 PM ET: Verizon says the credit can be claimed through customer service via phone, chat and online in addition to the myVerizon app. Update, January 16 2026, 10:29 AM ET: This story has been updated with detailed info about the redemption process which Verizon now says is completed with a link that will be texted to customers.

          "title": "Kilo launches AI-powered Slack bot that ships code from a chat message",
          "summary": "- Kilo Code, the open-source AI coding startup backed by GitLab cofounder Sid Sijbrandij, is launching a Slack integration that allows software engineering teams to execute code changes, debug issues, and push pull requests directly from their team chat — without opening an IDE or switching applications. The product, called Kilo for Slack, arrives as the AI-assisted coding market heats up with multibillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds. But rather than building another siloed coding assistant, Kilo is making a calculated bet: that the future of AI development tools lies not in locking engineers into a single interface, but in embedding AI capabilities into the fragmented workflows where decisions actually happen. \"Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,\" Scott Breitenother, Kilo Code's co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The Slackbot allows you to do all this — and more — without leaving Slack.\" The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax's M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models. How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chat The integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor. With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request. A typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \"@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\" The bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack. The company says the entire process eliminates the need to copy information between apps or jump between windows — developers can trigger complex code changes with nothing more than a single message in Slack. Why Kilo says Cursor and Claude Code fall short when developers need multi-repo context Kilo's launch explicitly positions the product against two leading AI coding tools: Cursor, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November, and Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Breitenother outlined specific limitations he sees in both products' Slack capabilities. \"The Cursor Slack integration is configured on a single-repository basis per workspace or channel,\" he said. \"As a result, if a Slack thread references multiple repositories, users need to manually switch or reconfigure the integration to pull in that additional context.\" On Anthropic's offering, he added: \"Claude Code documentation for Slack shows how Claude can be added to a workspace and respond to mentions using the surrounding conversation context. However, it does not describe persistent, multi-turn thread state or task-level continuity across longer workflows. Each interaction is handled based on the context included at the time of the prompt, rather than maintaining an evolving execution state over time.\" Kilo claims its integration works across multiple repositories simultaneously, maintains conversational context across extended Slack threads, and enables handoffs between Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, and the command-line interface. Kilo picks a Chinese AI company's model as its default—and addresses enterprise security concerns head-on Perhaps the most provocative element of the announcement is Kilo's choice of default model. MiniMax is headquartered in Shanghai and recently went public in Hong Kong — a lineage that may raise eyebrows among enterprise customers wary of sending proprietary code through Chinese infrastructure. Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \"MiniMax's recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\" He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year's re:Invent keynote, showing they're ready for enterprise use at scale.\" The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn't force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they're hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\" The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo's broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\" In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\" What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in Slack For engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration. Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it's mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack's standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\" For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can't see anything the user or workspace hasn't authorized.\" The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions. A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production? \"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\" He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\" The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won't kill the business Kilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product. The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version? \"Forking the code isn't what worries us, because the code itself isn't the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn't get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we've built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\" He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren't paying for access to code. They're paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\" Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disrupt Kilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft's codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor's November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion. Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy. Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab's own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\" Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That's not something we can disclose.\" How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI coding The most significant threat to Kilo's position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources. Breitenother argued that Kilo's advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance. \"We don't think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they'll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn't generating code, it's integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\" He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate: \"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\" \"Model flexibility: We're model-agnostic by design. Teams don't have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That's difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\" \"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn't trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\" The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem first Kilo's launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built. That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers. Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones. Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo's integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added. Usage-based pricing matches the rates of whatever model the team selects. Whether a 34-person startup can execute on that vision against competitors with billions in capital remains an open question. But if Breitenother is right that the hard problem in AI coding isn't generating code but integrating into workflows, Kilo may have picked the right fight. After all, the best AI in the world doesn't matter much if developers have to leave the conversation to use it.",

          "summary": "- Anthropic's open source standard, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in late 2024, allows users to connect AI models and the agents atop them to external tools in a structured, reliable format. It is the engine behind Anthropic's hit AI agentic programming harness, Claude Code, allowing it to access numerous functions like web browsing and file creation immediately when asked. But there was one problem: Claude Code typically had to \"read\" the instruction manual for every single tool available, regardless of whether it was needed for the immediate task, using up the available context that could otherwise be filled with more information from the user's prompts or the agent's responses. At least until last night. The Claude Code team released an update that fundamentally alters this equation. Dubbed MCP Tool Search, the feature introduces \"lazy loading\" for AI tools, allowing agents to dynamically fetch tool definitions only when necessary. It is a shift that moves AI agents from a brute-force architecture to something resembling modern software engineering—and according to early data, it effectively solves the \"bloat\" problem that was threatening to stifle the ecosystem. The 'Startup Tax' on Agents To understand the significance of Tool Search, one must understand the friction of the previous system. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in 2024 by Anthropic as an open source standard was designed to be a universal standard for connecting AI models to data sources and tools—everything from GitHub repositories to local file systems. However, as the ecosystem grew, so did the \"startup tax.\" Thariq Shihipar, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, highlighted the scale of the problem in the announcement. \"We've found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools,\" Shihipar wrote. \"Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.\" In practical terms, this meant a developer using a robust set of tools might sacrifice 33% or more of their available context window limit of 200,000 tokens before they even typed a single character of a prompt, as AI newsletter author Aakash Gupta pointed out in a post on X. The model was effectively \"reading\" hundreds of pages of technical documentation for tools it might never use during that session. Community analysis provided even starker examples. Gupta further noted that a single Docker MCP server could consume 125,000 tokens just to define its 135 tools. \"The old constraint forced a brutal tradeoff,\" he wrote. \"Either limit your MCP servers to 2-3 core tools, or accept that half your context budget disappears before you start working.\" How Tool Search Works The solution Anthropic rolled out — which Shihipar called \"one of our most-requested features on GitHub\" — is elegant in its restraint. Instead of preloading every definition, Claude Code now monitors context usage. According to the release notes, the system automatically detects when tool descriptions would consume more than 10% of the available context. When that threshold is crossed, the system switches strategies. Instead of dumping raw documentation into the prompt, it loads a lightweight search index. When the user asks for a specific action—say, \"deploy this container\"—Claude Code doesn't scan a massive, pre-loaded list of 200 commands. Instead, it queries the index, finds the relevant tool definition, and pulls only that specific tool into the context. \"Tool Search flips the architecture,\" Gupta analyzed. \"The token savings are dramatic: from ~134k to ~5k in Anthropic’s internal testing. That’s an 85% reduction while maintaining full tool access.\" For developers maintaining MCP servers, this shifts the optimization strategy. Shihipar noted that the `server instructions` field in the MCP definition—previously a \"nice to have\"—is now critical. It acts as the metadata that helps Claude \"know when to search for your tools, similar to skills.\" 'Lazy Loading' and Accuracy Gains While the token savings are the headline metric—saving money and memory is always popular—the secondary effect of this update might be more important: focus. LLMs are notoriously sensitive to \"distraction.\" When a model's context window is stuffed with thousands of lines of irrelevant tool definitions, its ability to reason decreases. It creates a \"needle in a haystack\" problem where the model struggles to differentiate between similar commands, such as `notification-send-user` versus `notification-send-channel`. Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code, emphasized this in his reaction to the launch on X: \"Every Claude Code user just got way more context, better instruction following, and the ability to plug in even more tools.\" The data backs this up. Internal benchmarks shared by the community indicate that enabling Tool Search improved the accuracy of the Opus 4 model on MCP evaluations from 49% to 74%. For the newer Opus 4.5, accuracy jumped from 79.5% to 88.1%. By removing the noise of hundreds of unused tools, the model can dedicate its \"attention\" mechanisms to the user's actual query and the relevant active tools. Maturing the Stack This update signals a maturation in how we treat AI infrastructure. In the early days of any software paradigm, brute force is common. But as systems scale, efficiency becomes the primary engineering challenge. Aakash Gupta drew a parallel to the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VSCode or JetBrains. \"The bottleneck wasn’t 'too many tools.' It was loading tool definitions like 2020-era static imports instead of 2024-era lazy loading,\" he wrote. \"VSCode doesn’t load every extension at startup. JetBrains doesn’t inject every plugin’s docs into memory.\" By adopting \"lazy loading\"—a standard best practice in web and software development—Anthropic is acknowledging that AI agents are no longer just novelties; they are complex software platforms that require architectural discipline. Implications for the Ecosystem For the end user, this update is seamless: Claude Code simply feels \"smarter\" and retains more memory of the conversation. But for the developer ecosystem, it opens the floodgates. Previously, there was a \"soft cap\" on how capable an agent could be. Developers had to curate their toolsets carefully to avoid lobotomizing the model with excessive context. With Tool Search, that ceiling is effectively removed. An agent can theoretically have access to thousands of tools—database connectors, cloud deployment scripts, API wrappers, local file manipulators—without paying a penalty until those tools are actually touched. It turns the \"context economy\" from a scarcity model into an access model. As Gupta summarized, \"They’re not just optimizing context usage. They’re changing what ‘tool-rich agents’ can mean.\" The update is rolling out immediately for Claude Code users. For developers building MCP clients, Anthropic recommends implementing the `ToolSearchTool` to support this dynamic loading, ensuring that as the agentic future arrives, it doesn't run out of memory before it even says hello.",

        "summary_markdown": "- Kilo Code, the open-source AI coding startup backed by GitLab cofounder Sid Sijbrandij, is launching a Slack integration that allows software engineering teams to execute code changes, debug issues, and push pull requests directly from their team chat — without opening an IDE or switching applications. The product, called Kilo for Slack, arrives as the AI-assisted coding market heats up with multibillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds. But rather than building another siloed coding assistant, Kilo is making a calculated bet: that the future of AI development tools lies not in locking engineers into a single interface, but in embedding AI capabilities into the fragmented workflows where decisions actually happen. \"Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,\" Scott Breitenother, Kilo Code's co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The Slackbot allows you to do all this — and more — without leaving Slack.\" The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax's M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models. How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chat The integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor. With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request. A typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \"@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\" The bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack. The company says the entire process eliminates the need to copy information between apps or jump between windows — developers can trigger complex code changes with nothing more than a single message in Slack. Why Kilo says Cursor and Claude Code fall short when developers need multi-repo context Kilo's launch explicitly positions the product against two leading AI coding tools: Cursor, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November, and Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Breitenother outlined specific limitations he sees in both products' Slack capabilities. \"The Cursor Slack integration is configured on a single-repository basis per workspace or channel,\" he said. \"As a result, if a Slack thread references multiple repositories, users need to manually switch or reconfigure the integration to pull in that additional context.\" On Anthropic's offering, he added: \"Claude Code documentation for Slack shows how Claude can be added to a workspace and respond to mentions using the surrounding conversation context. However, it does not describe persistent, multi-turn thread state or task-level continuity across longer workflows. Each interaction is handled based on the context included at the time of the prompt, rather than maintaining an evolving execution state over time.\" Kilo claims its integration works across multiple repositories simultaneously, maintains conversational context across extended Slack threads, and enables handoffs between Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, and the command-line interface. Kilo picks a Chinese AI company's model as its default—and addresses enterprise security concerns head-on Perhaps the most provocative element of the announcement is Kilo's choice of default model. MiniMax is headquartered in Shanghai and recently went public in Hong Kong — a lineage that may raise eyebrows among enterprise customers wary of sending proprietary code through Chinese infrastructure. Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \"MiniMax's recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\" He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year's re:Invent keynote, showing they're ready for enterprise use at scale.\" The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn't force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they're hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\" The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo's broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\" In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\" What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in Slack For engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration. Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it's mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack's standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\" For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can't see anything the user or workspace hasn't authorized.\" The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions. A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production? \"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\" He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\" The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won't kill the business Kilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product. The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version? \"Forking the code isn't what worries us, because the code itself isn't the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn't get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we've built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\" He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren't paying for access to code. They're paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\" Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disrupt Kilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft's codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor's November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion. Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy. Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab's own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\" Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That's not something we can disclose.\" How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI coding The most significant threat to Kilo's position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources. Breitenother argued that Kilo's advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance. \"We don't think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they'll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn't generating code, it's integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\" He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate: \"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\" \"Model flexibility: We're model-agnostic by design. Teams don't have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That's difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\" \"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn't trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\" The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem first Kilo's launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built. That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers. Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones. Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo's integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added. Usage-based pricing matches the rates of whatever model the team selects. Whether a 34-person startup can execute on that vision against competitors with billions in capital remains an open question. But if Breitenother is right that the hard problem in AI coding isn't generating code but integrating into workflows, Kilo may have picked the right fight. After all, the best AI in the world doesn't matter much if developers have to leave the conversation to use it.",

          "title": "OWASP Top 10 2025: What's changed and why it matters",
          "summary": "The OWASP Foundation has released the eighth edition of its influential \"Top 10 Security Risks\" list for 2025, introducing significant changes that reflect the evolving landscape of application security. Based on analysis of more than 175,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) records and feedback from security practitioners across the globe, this update addresses modern attack vectors. Here's everything you need to know about what's changed, why these changes matter, and how to protect your systems. 💡 Join GitLab Transcend on February 10 to learn how agentic AI transforms software delivery. Hear from customers and discover how to jumpstart your own modernization journey. Register now. What's new in 2025? The shift from 2021 (the last time the list came out) to 2025 represents more than minor adjustments, it's a fundamental shift in application security. Two entirely new categories entered the list and one category was consolidated into another, which highlights emerging risks that traditional testing often misses. These additions and shifts can be seen in the chart below: Two new categories A03: Software Supply Chain Failures: Expands the 2021 category \"Vulnerable and Outdated Components\" to encompass the entire software supply chain, including dependencies, build systems, and distribution infrastructure. Despite having the fewest occurrences in testing data, this category has the highest average exploit and impact scores from CVEs. A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions: Focuses on improper error handling, logical errors, and failing open scenarios. This addresses how systems respond to abnormal conditions. Major ranking changes Security Misconfiguration surged from #5 (2021) to #2 (2025), now affecting 3% of tested applications. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) has been consolidated into A01: Broken Access Control. Cryptographic Failures dropped from #2 to #4. Injection fell from #3 to #5. Insecure Design moved from #4 to #6. Why these changes were made The OWASP methodology combines data-driven analysis with community insights. The 2025 edition analyzed 589 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), which is a substantial increase from the approximately 400 CWEs in 2021. This expansion reflects the growing complexity of modern software systems and the need to capture emerging threats. The community survey component addresses a fundamental limitation: testing data essentially looks into the past. By the time security researchers develop testing methodologies and integrate them into automated tools, years may have passed. The two community-voted categories ensure that emerging risks identified by frontline practitioners are included, even if they're not yet prevalent in automated testing data. The rise of Security Misconfiguration highlights an industry trend toward configuration-based security, while Software Supply Chain Failures acknowledges the rise of sophisticated attacks targeting compromised packages. Using GitLab Ultimate for vulnerability detection and management GitLab Ultimate provides comprehensive security scanning to detect risks across the 2025 OWASP Top 10 categories. For instance, the end-to-end platform analyzes your project's source code, dependencies, and infrastructure definitions. It also uses Advanced Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to detect injection flaws, cryptographic failures, and insecure design patterns in source code. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning finds security misconfigurations in your deployment definitions. Secret Detection prevents the leakage of credentials, and Dependency Scanning uncovers libraries with known vulnerabilities in your software supply chain, which directly addresses the new A03 category for Software Supply Chain Failures. In addition: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) probes your deployed application for broken access control, authentication failures, and injection vulnerabilities by simulating attack vectors. API Security Testing probes your API endpoints for input validation weaknesses and authentication bypasses. Web API Fuzz Testing uncovers how your application handles exceptional conditions by generating unexpected inputs, which directly addresses the new A10 category for mishandling of exceptional conditions. Security scanning integrates seamlessly into your CI/CD pipeline, running when code is pushed from a feature branch so developers can remediate vulnerabilities before they reach production. Security findings are consolidated in the Vulnerability Report, where security teams can triage, analyze, and track remediation. GitLab also allows you to leverage AI agents such as Security Analyst Agent, available in GitLab Duo Agent Platform, to quickly determine what are the most critical vulnerabilities and how to take action on them. You can enforce additional controls through merge request approval policies and pipeline execution policies to ensure security scanning runs consistently across your organization. Customer Success and Professional Services teams at GitLab ensure you derive value from an investment in GitLab in a timely manner. Deliver secure software faster with security testing in the same platform developers already use. To learn more, visit our application security testing solutions site.

By following these best practices you can enhance and maintain your security posture: Automated security scanning for all repositories Perform SAST Scanning to detect insecure design patterns like plaintext password storage, inadequate error handling, and missing encryption during code review, catching design flaws early in the development lifecycle. Perform Secret Detection to identify credentials in configuration files, environment variables, and code, preventing plaintext password storage and ensuring secrets are properly managed through GitLab's CI/CD variables with masking and encryption. Perform DAST Scanning to detect broken access control vulnerabilities Perform Dependency Scanning to scan project dependencies against vulnerability databases, identifying known CVEs in direct and transitive dependencies across multiple package managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.). Perform Container Scanning to analyze Docker images for vulnerable base layers and packages, ensuring container supply chain security before deployment. Perform IaC Scanning to check your infrastructure definition files for known vulnerabilities. Leverage API Security Tools to secure and protect web APIs from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks. Perform Web API Fuzz Testing to discover bugs and potential vulnerabilities that other QA processes might miss. View vulnerabilities detected in MR with diff from feature branch to main branch. Understand your security posture Generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) for complete dependency visibility and compliance requirements. Leverage the Vulnerability Report to sort through and triage vulnerabilites via consolidated view of security vulnerabilities found in your codebase. Quickly take action on vulnerabilities using detailed remdiation guidance and risk assessment data. Use Security Iventory to visualize which assets you need to secure and understand the actions you need to take to improve security. Leverage Compliance Center to manage compliance standards adherence reporting, violations reporting, and compliance frameworks. Use Security Inventory to viewing enabled security scanners and vulnerabilities. Set up prevention and maintain documentation Configure Security Policies to block merges or deployments when high-severity vulnerabilities are detected in dependencies, enforcing security standards automatically. Use Compliance Frameworks to enforce organizational security standards through automated policy checks that verify encryption requirements, credential management practices, and secure workflow implementations are followed. Use GitLab Wiki and repository documentation to maintain security design principles, approved patterns, and architectural decision records that guide developers toward secure-by-design implementations. Implement merge request approval rules requiring security architect review for features involving authentication, authorization, encryption, or sensitive data handling, ensuring design-level security validation. Create tests to verify input validation and allowlist approaches for file paths Use GitLab Issues and Epics to document security requirements and threat models during the design phase, creating a traceable record of security decisions and ensuring security considerations are addressed before implementation begins. View and set Security Policies scoped to instance, group, or project. Leverage AI Use Code Suggestions for proactive guidance during development, suggesting secure design patterns like proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2), encrypted storage mechanisms, and appropriate error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information. Use Security Analyst Agent to review detected insecure design vulnerabilities in context, explaining the architectural implications, assessing risk based on your application's threat model, and providing remediation strategies that address root design flaws rather than just symptoms. Review your code using AI to help ensure consistent code review standards in your project. Leverage Security Analyst Agent to quickly triage and assess security vulnerabilities. Key takeaways for development teams Supply chain security is critical: With A03's addition and high-impact scores, securing your software supply chain is no longer optional. Implement SBOM tracking, dependency scanning, and integrity verification throughout your pipeline. Configuration matters more than ever: The rise to #2 shows that configuration-based security is now a primary attack vector. Automate configuration verification and implement IaC with security baked in. Traditional threats persist: While Injection and Cryptographic Failures dropped in ranking, they remain critical. Don't deprioritize them just because they've fallen on the list. Error handling is security: The new A10 category emphasizes that how your application handles failures is a security concern. Implement secure error handling from the start. Testing must evolve: The expanded CWE coverage (589 vs. 400 in 2021) means testing strategies must be comprehensive. Combine SAST, DAST, source code analysis, and manual penetration testing for effective coverage.

          "summary": "- YouTube channel Hardware Unboxed is reporting that ASUS has stopped producing the RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB due to the ongoing memory crunch. In its most recent video, the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it. Hardware Unboxed also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year. The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well,\" with ASUS stating it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to manufacture in the current economic climate. And while there might be some hope of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB returning later this year, the channel suggests both are unlikely to make a comeback. “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget. ASUS did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. After uploading its video, Hardware Unboxed published a clarification. “ASUS did not tell us that NVIDIA said the RTX 5070 Ti has been discontinued. ASUS told us there is very little supply of the 5070 Ti, so their own 5070 Ti products (e.g, the Prime and TUF Gaming) have been put into end of life status,” the channel said. “With retailers also unable to source 5070 Ti SKUs from any AIB, this effectively makes it a dead product.” The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer RAM kits, GPUs and SSDs. In December, Micron Technology announced it would wind down its consumer-facing Crucial brand to focus exclusively on providing components to the AI industry. ASUS is the first of NVIDIA’s add-in board (AIB) partners to comment on the memory crunch. AIBs are the companies that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy from NVIDIA and AMD. Historically, NVIDIA has provided its board partners with both the die and memory needed to make a graphics cards. However, a recent rumor suggested the company had told it partners they would need to start sourcing memory on their own. Update 12:55PM ET: Added more context. Update 2:06PM ET: Added comment from NVIDIA. Update 6:31PM ET: Added additional comment from Hardware Unboxed.

The new campaign created in collaboration with photographer Daniel Sannwald features a massively oversized Ohtani sporting Beats products in various Los Angeles settings. Against iconic LA backdrops, each image amplifies Ohtani's scale—not just physically, but metaphorically. He becomes an elevated figure of pride, strength, and aspiration. Through dramatic scale and surreal energy, the campaign transforms LA into Ohtani's playground—a cityscape where sport and culture intersect. Back to back champion. 4-time MVP. Shohei Ohtani is larger than life. 歴史に残る2連覇。4度目のMVP。大谷翔平、想像を超えたその先へ。 pic.twitter.com/JLHizt5eKO — Beats by Dre (@beatsbydre) January 14, 2026 In the images, Ohtani wears several of the latest Beats products, including Beats Studio Pro, Powerbeats Pro 2, and Powerbeats Fit. \"Los Angeles is a city of energy, culture, and ambition,\" says Shohei Ohtani. \"Wearing Beats and seeing myself rise above the skyline feels symbolic of the connection I have with this city and our fans. We rise high together.\" Ohtani has won four Major League Baseball MVP awards in Los Angeles, including two American League awards with the Los Angeles Angels in 2021 and 2023 and two National League awards with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2024 and again in 2025 as the Dodgers won back-to-back World Series titles.

          "title": "New Studio Display or Pro Display XDR Spotted in Regulatory Database",
          "summary": "An unreleased Apple monitor with the model number A3350 surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database today, according to a filing viewed by MacRumors. The filing is likely for Apple's next-generation Studio Display or Pro Display XDR, but there is not enough information to determine which one it will be. The listing does reveal that the new model will be equipped with a high-performance LCD display. The existing Studio Display and Pro Display XDR both have an LCD panel, so unfortunately this information does not help to pinpoint things. However, it does seemingly rule out an OLED display for this new model in particular. ProMotion support for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19 or A19 Pro chip. A new Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting would still have an LCD panel, so the filing does not rule out that possibility. The current Studio Display was filed in the same database around three months before it launched in March 2022, so perhaps the next Studio Display will be released around March or April this year, if that is what the filing is for. It would make sense for Apple to unveil a new Studio Display alongside the next Mac Studio with M5 chips. There have been fewer rumors about a new Pro Display XDR, but that model was released in December 2019, so it is certainly due for an update. If the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more. The current Studio Display features a 27-inch LCD screen with 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and a trio of USB-C ports. In the U.S., it starts at $1,599. Thanks, Aaron!

          "summary": "Spotify today announced a price increase in the United States, Estonia, and Latvia, marking the company's third U.S. price increase in less than three years. The company revealed the changes in a post published on its website earlier today, stating that Premium subscribers in the affected markets will receive an email over the coming month explaining how the new pricing will apply to their accounts. Spotify said that the revised prices will take effect on subscribers' next billing date, while new customers will see the updated pricing immediately when signing up on spotify.com/premium. In the United States, Spotify is increasing the cost of every major Premium tier. The Individual Premium plan will rise from $11.99 to $12.99 per month. The Student plan will increase from $5.99 to $6.99 per month. Multi-user plans are seeing larger increases, with the Duo plan, which supports two accounts, moving from $16.99 to $18.99 per month, and the Family plan increasing from $19.99 to $21.99 per month. Spotify attributed the changes to what it described as periodic adjustments across its markets: Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists. This latest increase is the third time Spotify has raised U.S. subscription prices since mid-2023. In July 2023, Spotify implemented its first U.S. price hike since launching in the country in 2011, increasing the Individual Premium plan from its long-standing $9.99 monthly price. A second increase followed in June 2024, bringing the Individual plan to $11.99 per month. The January 2026 change moves that price another dollar higher, continuing a pattern of more frequent adjustments after more than a decade of unchanged pricing. August 2025, and previously raised prices in regions including the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

          "summary": "We’re excited to announce the general availability of GitLab Duo Agent Platform. This is an important moment for GitLab, our customers and the industry at large. It is our first step in delivering our vision to bring agentic AI into the entire software development lifecycle. AI tools have been rapidly improving developers’ ability to write code, and in some cases, developers are reporting 10x productivity gains. Unfortunately, since only about 20% of a developer’s time is spent writing code, the associated improvement in total innovation velocity and delivery gained by AI is incremental. This is often described as the AI paradox in software delivery. In addition, for many teams, increasing the speed of code authoring has led to new bottlenecks including a larger backlog of code reviews, security vulnerabilities, compliance checks and downstream bug fixes. GitLab Duo Agent Platform addresses the AI paradox by unlocking intelligent orchestration and agentic AI automation across the software lifecycle. Learn more in this video, and read more below. 💡 Join GitLab Transcend on February 10 to learn how agentic AI transforms software delivery. Hear from customers and discover how to jumpstart your own modernization journey. Register now. We're also excited to announce that GitLab customers with active GitLab Premium and Ultimate subscriptions are being credited with $12 and $24 dollars, respectively, in GitLab Credits per user at no additional cost.* These credits will refresh every month and give users access to all GitLab Duo Agent Platform features. Here is a simple explanation for how GitLab Credits work: a GitLab Credit is a virtual currency used for GitLab’s usage-based products. GitLab Duo Agent Platform usage will draw down on available credits, starting with the included credits mentioned above. From there, customers can decide to commit to a shared pool of credits for their entire organization, or pay for them monthly, on demand. For more information, please check out our article introducing GitLab Credits. Customers of GitLab Duo Pro or Duo Enterprise subscriptions are welcome to continue using those products, or migrate to Duo Agent Platform at any time. The remainder of your Duo Enterprise contract value can be converted into GitLab Credits at any time. Contact your GitLab representative to learn more. Here are exciting use cases and capabilities you can try today: A unified experience for human and agent collaboration GitLab Duo Agent Platform introduces a unified user experience designed for seamless integration between humans and their AI agents inside GitLab. Developers and their teams can engage Duo Agentic Chat on nearly every page, ask questions contextually, follow async agentic sessions and interact with agents within familiar workflows like issues, merge requests, and pipeline activities — making AI actions transparent and easy to guide through everyday work. Agentic Chat: Intelligent, context-aware assistance Gitlab Duo Agentic Chat brings true multi-step reasoning across the GitLab Web UI and IDEs, using full lifecycle context from issues, merge requests, pipelines, security findings, and more. Building on the previously released Duo Chat, Agentic Chat can perform actions on your behalf autonomously and help you answer complex questions more comprehensively. It gives every member of the software team accurate, context-aware guidance that helps improve onboarding, code quality, and delivery speed. GitLab Duo Agentic Chat supports numerous use cases to enable developer <> AI collaboration. For additional details on how to get started, please see our \"Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform\" guide and check out this growing set of suggested prompts. Analyze In the Web UI, Agentic Chat can create issues, epics, merge requests, and provide summaries, highlight key findings, and offer actionable guidance based on real-time context from the specific project, issue, epic, merge request, and more. Agentic Chat helps developers understand unfamiliar code, dependencies, architecture, and project structure, in the IDE or inside a GitLab repo. Code Agentic Chat can generate code, configurations, and infrastructure-as-code across a wide range of languages and frameworks. It can help fix bugs, modernize architecture and code, generate tests, and produce documentation for faster onboarding. Directly at developers' fingertips, Agentic Chat is their collaboration partner in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Cursor, and Windsurf, with optional user- and workspace-level rules to tailor responses. CI/CD Agentic Chat can help you better understand, configure, and troubleshoot existing pipelines, or create new ones from scratch. Secure Agentic Chat can explain vulnerabilities, prioritize issues based on reachability, and recommend fixes that can help save you time. Agents: Specialists that collaborate on demand GitLab Duo Agent Platform enables developers to delegate tasks to specialized agents. The platform offers a unique combination of foundational, custom, and external agents, all seamlessly integrated into GitLab user experience, making it easy to choose the right agent for any task. Foundational agents are pre-built by GitLab experts and are ready out-of-the-box to handle the most complex tasks in the software delivery cycle. The following foundational agents are included as part of GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s general availability, with others currently in beta and coming soon. Planner Agent helps teams structure, prioritize, and break down work directly inside GitLab so planning becomes clearer, faster, and easier to act on. Security Analyst Agent reviews vulnerabilities and security signals, explains their impact in plain language, and helps teams understand what to address first. Custom agents can be built using the AI Catalog, a central repository where teams create, publish, manage, and share custom agents and flows across the organization. Teams can create agents and flows with specific context and capabilities to replicate the way their engineering team works — and tackle problems using the engineering standards and guardrails their engineers use. External agents are seamlessly integrated into GitLab and include some of the very best AI tools available, including Claude Code from Anthropic and Codex CLI from OpenAI. Users will enjoy native GitLab access to these tools for use cases like code generation, code review, and analysis with transparent security and embedded LLM subscriptions. Together, these approaches give teams flexibility in how they adopt agentic AI, from specialized agents, to organization-specific automation, to integrating external AI tools — all within a single, governed platform. Flows: Turning multi-step work into repeatable, guided progress Flows automate complex tasks with multiple agentic workflows, from start to finish. Our engineering team has built several flows included at GA, with more on the way: Developer (Issue to Merge Request) flow builds a structured MR from a well-defined issue so teams can begin work immediately. Convert to GitLab CI/CD flow helps teams migrate or modernize pipeline configurations without manual rewriting. Fix CI/CD pipeline flow analyzes failures, identifies likely causes, and prepares recommended changes. Code Review flow analyzes code changes, merge request comments, and more to streamline code reviews with AI-native analysis and feedback. Software development in IDE flow guides work through everyday development and review stages. MCP Client: Connect GitLab Duo Agent Platform to the tools your teams already use The MCP Client enables GitLab Duo Agent Platform in IDEs to securely connect to external systems like Jira, Slack, Confluence, and other MCP-compatible tools to pull in context and take action across your DevSecOps toolchain. Instead of AI assistance being siloed inside individual tools, the MCP Client allows GitLab Duo Agent Platform to understand and operate across the systems where planning, collaboration, and execution actually happen. This reduces manual context switching and enables more complete, end-to-end AI-powered workflows that reflect how teams work in practice. Included at GA: Connection to external MCP-compatible systems such as Jira, Confluence, Slack, Playwright, and Grafana Configuration at the workspace and user level Group-level controls to enable or restrict MCP usage User approval flow for tool access Support across Agentic Chat in the IDE extensions We plan to add more features to the GitLab MCP server capability, which is currently in beta, and make it generally available in upcoming releases. Choose the right model for your team and workloads GitLab Duo Agent Platform is built on a flexible model selection framework that enables teams to tailor the platform to align with their privacy, security, and compliance needs. GitLab defaults to an optimal LLM for each feature, but administrators have the option to select from supported models such as OpenAI GPT-5 variants, Mistral, Meta Llama, and Anthropic Claude. This gives teams more precise control and flexibility over what is used for chat, coding tasks, and agent interactions for each specific use case, based on your organization’s standards. For a full list of supported models and details on model section configuration, see the Model Selection section of our documentation. Governance, visibility, and deployment flexibility The GitLab Duo Agent Platform gives organizations the control and transparency they need to help them adopt AI responsibly, while offering flexible deployment options that work across different environments. Included at GA: Available on all platforms: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated as part of the GitLab 18.8 release cycle. Governance and visibility: Teams can see how agents are used, what actions they perform, and how they contribute to work. Usage and activity details help leaders understand adoption, measure impact, and ensure AI is being used appropriately. These controls make it easier to roll out AI at scale with confidence. Group-based access controls: Administrators can define namespace-level rules governing which users can access GitLab Duo Agent Platform features, supporting flexible adoption from immediate organization-wide enablement to phased rollouts. With LDAP and SAML integration, they can enable governance at scale without manual configuration. Model selection and self-hosted options: LLM selection is available for all GA features across GitLab.com, Self-Managed, and Dedicated. Top-level namespace owners choose the model, and subgroups inherit those settings automatically. For organizations that want more control, the platform supports self-hosted models for GitLab Self-Managed deployments. Watch a demo of GitLab Duo Agent Platform in action: Stay up to date with GitLab To make sure you’re getting the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements, we recommend keeping your GitLab instance up to date.

          "summary": "Welcome to Part 5 of our eight-part guide, Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform, where you'll master building and deploying AI agents and workflows within your development lifecycle. Follow tutorials that take you from your first interaction to production-ready automation workflows with full customization. In this article: What is the AI Catalog? Browsing and enabling agents and flows Creating, sharing, and managing visibility Understanding versioning 🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today! Introduction to the AI Catalog The AI Catalog is a central repository for discovering, creating, and sharing agents and flows across your organization. It promotes consistency, reusability, and collaboration by enabling teams to leverage pre-built solutions and best practices. What you can do: Discover: Browse agents and flows created by GitLab and the community. Create: Create and maintain custom agents and flows in a single interface. Enable: Enable agents and flows at your top-level group level, then use them in your projects. Share: Publish your agents and flows for others to use (Public or Private). Duplicate: Copy and customize existing agents and flows. AI Catalog Accessing and working with the AI Catalog Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog. The catalog currently provides two types: Agents — Custom agents for on-demand, interactive, or context-specific tasks. Flows — Custom flows for repeatable, multi-step automations, orchestrating a team of agents. For detailed information, see the AI Catalog documentation. Discover agents and flows The AI Catalog makes it easy to find agents and flows that fit your needs: How to browse: Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog. Select either Agents or Flows tab. Browse the available agents or flows and inspect title, description and visibility status. Click on any agent or flow to view more details. Enabling agents and flows: Once you find an agent or flow you want to use: Click the agent or flow to view details. Click the Enable in group button to add the agent or flow to your top-level group. Enable it in your project to start using it. Creating, sharing, and managing visibility Create agents and flows Here are step-by-step instructions for creating agents and flows. Create agents: Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Agents → New agent. Brainstorm and define a specific task or specialization for this agent, for example, a debugging and troubleshooting agent. Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the agent, for example troubleshoot-debugger. Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments. Define the agent behavior, capabilities, and specialization in the system prompt. For details on crafting effective system prompts, see Part 3: Understanding agents. Optionally select and limit the tool access for agents. For example, a debugging agent needs read access to code, issues, and merge requests, but may not require write access to make changes. Create flows: Navigate to Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow. Brainstorm and define a complex multi-step specific task, for example, a CI/CD pipeline optimizer flow. Add a display name and description to allow others to identify the purpose and why they would want to use the flow, for example ci-cd-optimizer. Specify visibility and access. Select a private project and set visibility to private to start with experiments. Define the flow behavior and its agent components, prompts, and routers. For details on flow YAML structure, see Part 4: Understanding flows. For more details, see: Custom Agents documentation Custom Flows documentation Share your work and set visibility When creating agents or flows, you can choose between Private and Public visibility to control who can access and use them. Private: Can be viewed only by members of the managing project who have at least the Developer role, or by users with the Owner role for the top-level group. Cannot be enabled in other projects. Useful for team-specific or sensitive workflows. Public: Viewable by anyone on the instance. Can be enabled in any project that meets prerequisites. Appears in AI Catalog for discovery. Best practices for sharing When publishing agents and flows to the AI Catalog, follow these guidelines: Naming: Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., security-code-review, api-documentation-generator). Avoid generic names like agent1 or my-flow. Include the purpose in the name when possible. Documentation: Provide a clear description of what the agent or flow does. Include use cases and examples. Document any prerequisites or dependencies. Quality: Test thoroughly before publishing. Ensure the agent or flow solves a real problem. Keep it maintainable and well-documented. Consider edge cases and error handling. Visibility decisions: Start with Private to test with your team. Move to Public once validated and documented. Only publish if it provides value to others. Consider the audience and use cases. Understanding versioning Custom agents and flows in the AI Catalog maintain a version history to track changes. How versioning works: GitLab automatically creates a new version when you update an agent's system prompt or modify a flow's configuration. Versions use semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0). GitLab manages semantic versioning automatically — updates always increment the minor version. Versions are immutable, ensuring consistent behavior. Version pinning: When you enable an agent or flow: In a group: GitLab pins it to the latest version. In a project: GitLab pins it to the same version as your top-level group. This means: Your projects use a fixed, stable version of the agent or flow. Updates in the AI Catalog don't automatically affect your configuration. You must opt-in to update to new versions — updates are never automatic. You maintain full control over when to adopt new versions. Viewing versions: Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows. Select the agent or flow to view its version on the right side in the About section. Updating to the latest version When a new version of an agent or flow is available in the AI Catalog, you can update your projects to use it. Navigate to Automate → Agents or Automate → Flows. Click the agent or flow you want to update. Click the Update button (appears when a newer version is available). Review the changes in the new version. Confirm the update to pin your project to the latest version. What's next? You now understand how to discover, create, and share agents and flows through the AI Catalog. Next, in Part 6, learn how to monitor agent and flow activity through sessions, set up event-driven triggers, and manage your AI workflows.

          "summary": "Welcome to Part 8 of our eight-part guide, Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform, where you'll master building and deploying AI agents and workflows within your development lifecycle. Follow tutorials that take you from your first interaction to production-ready automation workflows with full customization. In this article: Introduction to customization Customize agent behavior Extend capabilities with MCP Create custom agents and flows 🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today! Introduction to customization GitLab Duo Agent Platform delivers powerful capabilities right away, and you can unlock even greater value by tailoring it to your team's specific needs. GitLab offers flexible customization options across multiple levels: User-level: Personal preferences that apply across all projects (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config) Workspace-level: Project-specific configurations (custom rules, AGENTS.md, MCP config) Project-level: Custom agents and flows you create and manage within a specific project Part 1: Customize agent behavior Custom rules Custom rules provide instructions for agents and flows, ensuring consistent behavior across your team without requiring repetition. For example, in development style guides or how to execute tests. Navigate to IDE workspace or user configuration directory. User-level custom rules User-level rules apply to all your projects and workspaces. For detailed instructions on creating user-level custom rules, see the GitLab documentation. Create the file ~/.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your home directory. Example rules: - Include JSDoc comments for all functions - Use single quotes for strings - Follow the existing code style in the repository - Write concise explanations, avoid lengthy descriptions - Suggest tests for any code changes - Use async/await instead of promises Workspace-level custom rules Workspace rules apply only to a specific project. They override user-level rules for that project. Create the file .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md in your project root. Example rules for a Vue.js project: - Use Vue 3 Composition API with ` ` - Always include TypeScript types for props - Use scoped styles with SCSS - Follow the Slippers UI design system - Keep components under 300 lines - Use kebab-case for component names - Include accessibility attributes (aria-*, role) Best practices for custom rules Be specific: \"Use single quotes\" is better than \"follow style guide.\" Prioritize: List most important rules first. Team-focused: Rules should reflect your team's standards, not personal preferences. Actionable: Rules should be clear enough for an AI agent to follow. Maintainable: Update rules when your standards change. Avoid conflicts: Don't contradict your codebase's actual style. Tip: Use Code Owners to manage who approves changes to .gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md. For a detailed use case tutorial for custom rules, see the Custom rules in GitLab Duo Agentic Chat for greater developer efficiency deep-dive blog post. AGENTS.md for customizing agent behavior AGENTS.md is an industry-standard file for customizing agent behavior. It allows you to define how agents should behave in your chat conversations, foundational flows, and custom flows without modifying the agents themselves. Difference to custom rules: AGENTS.md are consumed by all agents and flows (foundational and custom). It also follows an industry standard that other AI tools can use, for example, Claude Code as external agent. Use AGENTS.md when you want your instructions to apply across multiple contexts. User-level (applies to all your projects and workspaces): macOS/Linux: ~/.gitlab/duo/AGENTS.md Windows: %APPDATA%\\GitLab\\duo\\AGENTS.md Workspace-level (applies to a specific project): Create AGENTS.md in your project root. Subdirectory-level (applies to specific directories in monorepos): Create AGENTS.md in subdirectories for context-specific instructions. How it works: User-level AGENTS.md applies globally across all projects. Workspace-level AGENTS.md applies to a specific project. Subdirectory-level AGENTS.md files provide context for specific parts of your codebase. Agents and flows combines instructions from all applicable levels. Newly added or updated AGENTS.md instructions require triggering new flows, or starting a new chat with a (custom) agent. What AGENTS.md controls Agent personality and tone Project-specific instructions Coding standards and conventions Tool usage preferences Output formatting requirements Repository structure and organization Example AGENTS.md # Agent Customization for Our Project ## General Guidelines - Always prioritize code quality over speed - Follow our project's architecture patterns - Reference existing code examples when suggesting changes - Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous ## Code Style - Use TypeScript for all new code - Follow ESLint configuration in the project - Include unit tests for all new functions - Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loops) ## Documentation - Add JSDoc comments to all public functions - Update README.md if adding new features - Include examples in code comments ## Security - Never suggest hardcoding secrets or API keys - Always validate user input - Use parameterized queries for database operations - Flag potential security issues immediately Best practices for AGENTS.md Be specific: Include concrete examples from your project. Keep it concise: Focus on what's unique to your project. Version control: Commit to your repository and track changes. Team alignment: Discuss with your team before finalizing. Update regularly: Refine as your project evolves. Document repository structure: Help agents understand your codebase organization. Requirements GitLab 18.8 or later For VS Code: GitLab Workflow extension 6.60 or later For JetBrains: GitLab plugin 3.26.0 or later For flows: Update flow configuration to access the user_rule context Learn more about AGENTS.md. Custom review instructions Custom review instructions provide specific guidelines for the Code Review foundational flow. The instructions ensure consistent code review standards, and can be tailored to specific file types in your project. Create the file .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml in your project root. Example review instructions: instructions: - name: Ruby Style Guide fileFilters: - \"*.rb\" # Ruby files in the root directory - \"lib/**/*.rb\" # Ruby files in lib and its subdirectories - \"!spec/**/*.rb\" # Exclude test files instructions: | 1. Ensure all methods have proper documentation 2. Follow Ruby style guide conventions 3. Prefer symbols over strings for hash keys - name: TypeScript Source Files fileFilters: - \"**/*.ts\" # TypeScript files in any directory - \"!**/*.test.ts\" # Exclude test files instructions: | 1. Ensure proper TypeScript types (avoid 'any') 2. Follow naming conventions 3. Document complex functions Best practices for custom review instructions: Be specific and actionable: Clear, numbered instructions work best. Use glob patterns: Target specific file types with fileFilters. Focus on important standards: Prioritize the most critical review points. Explain the \"why\": Help reviewers understand the reasoning. Test patterns: Ensure glob patterns match the intended files. Tip: Use Code Owners to protect changes to .gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml. For detailed setup instructions and examples, see the Custom Review Instructions documentation. Part 2: Extend capabilities with MCP Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to access external systems like Jira, Slack, AWS, and more. This section covers MCP configuration for extending agent capabilities. 🎯 Try it now: Interactive demo of MCP - Explore how to use Model Context Protocol. MCP configuration for external integrations Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables agents to access external systems like Jira, Slack, AWS, and more. Scope: User-level (applies to all workspaces) or Workspace-level (project-specific, overrides user config) Create user configuration: macOS/Linux: ~/.gitlab/duo/mcp.json Windows: C:\\Users\\ \\AppData\\Roaming\\GitLab\\duo\\mcp.json VS Code: Run command GitLab MCP: Open User Settings (JSON) Create workspace configuration: Create file: .gitlab/duo/mcp.json in your project root Best practices: Security first: Use MCP servers that require OAuth and not plain-text password tokens. Minimal scope: Only enable MCP servers you actually use and trust. Test locally: Verify MCP connections and authorization work before sharing across teams. Document integrations: Explain what each MCP server provides. Version control: Store configuration in .gitlab/duo/mcp.json with Code Owners' approval. For detailed setup instructions and configuration examples, see Part 7: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration. Part 3: Create custom agents and flows Custom agents and flows allow you to automate your team's specific workflows. Before diving into customization, it's helpful to understand what they are and how they work. Here are parts of the Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform guide that can help. Part 3: Understanding agents — Learn about foundational, custom, and external agents, and when to use each type. Part 4: Understanding flows — Discover how flows orchestrate multiple agents to solve complex problems. Part 5: AI Catalog — Learn how to discover, create, and share agents and flows across your organization. Once you understand the basics, this section provides an overview of customization options with links to detailed guides. System prompts for custom agents System prompts define an agent's personality, expertise, and behavior. A well-crafted prompt makes agents more effective and aligned with your team's needs. What are system prompts? System prompts are instructions that tell an agent how to behave, what expertise it has, and how to respond to requests. They're the foundation of custom agent behavior. Key elements of a strong system prompt: Role definition: What the agent is and what it does Expertise areas: Specific domains or technologies Behavior guidelines: How it should interact and respond Output format: Structure of responses Constraints: What it should avoid Best practices: Be detailed: More specific prompts produce better results. Use examples: Show the agent what good output looks like. Define scope: Clearly state what the agent should and shouldn't do. Test iteratively: Refine prompts based on agent behavior. Version control: Track prompt changes in your repository. For detailed guidance on crafting system prompts and creating custom agents, see Part 3: Understanding agents. Custom agents and flows There is a lot to learn, and for easier reading, the tutorials are split: Custom agents: Learn how to create agents with custom system prompts, configure tools, and manage permissions. See Part 3: Understanding agents - Custom agents section. Custom flows: Learn how to create multi-step workflows, configure components, and set up event-driven automation. See Part 4: Understanding flows — Custom flows section. Agent tools: Tools determine what actions agents can perform. Configure tools based on your agent's purpose and security requirements.

Unlike foundational and custom agents that use synchronous feedback loops, external agents execute asynchronously, enabling powerful automation with specialized AI providers. What makes agents powerful Specialized prompts: Each agent has a unique system prompt that defines its expertise, behavior, and communication style. Access to tools: Agents can read files, access issues/MRs/epics, search code, analyze CI/CD job logs and vulnerability reports, and more based on their configuration. Project context: Access to issues, merge requests, code, CI/CD pipelines, and security vulnerabilities. Learn more in Part 3: Understanding agents. Discover how to create custom agents, integrate external AI providers, and configure agent prompts and tools for your team's specific needs. Flows Flows are multi-step workflows that combine multiple actions to solve complex problems. Unlike agents that respond to questions, flows execute complete workflows autonomously via runner execution. TypeDescriptionWhere TriggeredSetup Required FoundationalMaintained by GitLab for common development workflows (Developer, Fix Pipeline, Convert Jenkins to GitLab CI/CD, Software Development)You invoke using dedicated UI action buttons, or using the IDE extension Flows tabNo CustomUser-defined workflows you create, tailored to your needsMentions in issues/MRs, assignmentYes What makes flows powerful Multi-step execution: Combine multiple operations into a single workflow Asynchronous processing: Run in background while you continue working Full pipeline access: Execute via runner execution with complete project context Event-driven: Automatically triggered by GitLab events Learn more in Part 4: Understanding flows, including multi-agent workflows. Agents vs. flows: What's the difference? Understanding when to use an agent vs. a flow is key to working effectively with GitLab Duo Agent Platform. AspectAgents (Interactive in Chat)Flows (Automated on Platform) PurposeInteractive work, quick iterations, conversational guidanceComplex multi-step tasks, background automation, event-driven workflows WhereGitLab Duo Chat (Web UI, IDEs)Issues, Merge Requests, UI action buttons HowReal-time conversation with ability to take actionsTriggered by events or button clicks ExecutionInteractive, runs immediately in chat contextAsynchronous via runner execution Example\"Refactor this function\" (agent modifies code), \"Create tests\" (agent generates test file)\"Generate MR for issue #123\" (flow creates branch, commits, opens MR) Quick decision guide Working interactively or want instant feedback? → Use chat Need background automation, MR review, or complex multi-file tasks? → Use flow Key insight Both agents and flows can take actions and create code. The main difference is how they interact and run: Agents communicate interactively in your chat interface, while flows run asynchronously in the background on platform compute. AI Catalog A centralized library where you can browse, discover, create, and share agents and flows across your organization, detailed in Part 5: AI Catalog. AI Catalog Automate capabilities Your hub for managing agent and flow workflows: Agents: View and manage agents in your project, detailed in Part 3. Flows: View, create, and manage flows in your project, detailed in Part 4.

In this article: Introduction to Automate capabilities Managing agents in your project Managing flows in your project Setting up event-driven triggers Monitoring flows activity with sessions 🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today! Introduction to the Automate capabilities The Automate capabilities are your central hub for managing AI workflows in GitLab. They provide visibility into agent and flow activity, and enable event-driven automation. Navigate to Project → Automate. The Automate menu provides these main sections: Agents: View, create, and manage agents in your project Flows: View, create, and manage flows in your project Triggers: Configure event-based automation for flows Sessions: Monitor agent and flow execution with detailed logs Managing agents The Agents section allows you to view, create, and manage agents in your project. Navigate to Automate → Agents. Both Agents and Flows sections provide two tabs for organizing your resources: Enabled: Agents/flows available to your project Managed: Agents/flows created and owned by your project To expand your available agents: Create new custom agents, enable at the top-level group, then enable them in your project. Browse the AI Catalog and enable existing agents in your top-level group first, then in your project. For details on creating custom agents, see Part 3: Understanding agents. Managing flows The Flows section allows you to view, create, and manage flows in your project. Navigate to Automate → Flows. To expand your available flows: Create new custom flows, enable at the top level group, then enable them in your project. Browse the AI Catalog and enable existing flows in your top-level group first, then in your project. For details on creating custom flows, see Part 4: Understanding flows. Automating with triggers Overview of auto-created triggers Triggers enable event-driven automation by automatically executing agents or flows when specific GitLab SDLC events occur. Navigate to Automate → Triggers. Available trigger event types: Mention: Mentioned in a comment, for example, @ci-cd-optimizer. Assign: Assigned to an issue or MR, for example, in the UI or quick action /assign @ci-cd-optimizer. Assign Reviewer: Assigned as MR reviewer, for example, in the UI or quick action /assign_reviewer @ci-cd-optimizer. How triggers work: Event occurs (e.g., @ci-cd-optimizer mentioned in MR comment) Trigger identifies the flow to execute Flow runs and starts a session Results posted back to the issue/MR For setup instructions, see the Triggers documentation. Monitoring with sessions Sessions provide transparency into agents and flows execution, including reasoning, executed tools, and outputs. Every run creates a session with an activity log. Sessions overview showing execution status and progress Navigate to Automate → Sessions. Sessions show: Execution status (Created, Running, Finished, Failed, Input Required, and more) Step-by-step progress and actions taken Agent reasoning and decision-making process Link to Runner job logs (Details tab) Activity tab The Activity tab displays the step-by-step execution flow, showing each action the agent took, the tools it used, and the results of those actions. Session activity showing step-by-step execution and agent actions Details tab The Details tab provides access to the complete runner job logs, allowing you to see the full execution context and any system-level information about the flow run. Session details with runner job logs and execution context The job logs contain the full execution output, including all system messages, tool invocations, and detailed information about what the flow executed. Complete runner job logs showing detailed execution output For more details, see the Sessions documentation. What's next?

The availability of foundational agents can be managed by namespace owners or instance administrators. Start the interaction with foundational agents by opening GitLab Duo Agentic Chat in the IDE or Web UI. GitLab Duo This is the default agent, your general-purpose development collaboration partner for creating and modifying code, opening merge requests, triaging and updating issues/epics, and running workflows with full SDLC platform context. Example prompts: \"Explain how the authentication system works.\" \"Where is the user profile logic located?\" \"How should I implement feature X?\" Planner Agent Helps with product planning, breaking down epics, and creating structured issues. Example prompts: \"Create an epic for the new payment system with subtasks.\" \"Break down issue #789 into smaller tasks.\" \"Generate acceptance criteria for this feature.\" Learn more about Planner Agent. Security Analyst Agent Triages vulnerabilities, identifies false positives, and prioritizes security risks. Example prompts: \"Triage all vulnerabilities from the latest scan.\" \"Which SAST findings are false positives?\" \"Prioritize security issues by actual risk\" Learn more about Security Analyst Agent. Data Analyst Agent Queries, visualizes, and surfaces data across the GitLab platform using GitLab Query Language (GLQL) to provide actionable insights about your projects and teams. Example prompts: \"How many merge requests were created in the last quarter?\" \"Show me what each team member has worked on this month.\" \"What are the trends in issue resolution times?\" \"Find all open issues with the 'bug' label in my project.\" \"Generate a GLQL query to count merge requests by author.\" Learn more about Data Analyst Agent. Custom agents Create your own agents tailored to your team's specific workflows and standards. Common use cases Troubleshooting and Debugging Agent: Debug software bugs and regressions, and analyze deployment failures. Documentation Agent: Maintain docs following your conventions. Onboarding Assistant: Help new team members with company-specific practices. Compliance Monitor: Ensure regulatory requirements are met. Localized Support Agent: Triage support issues in a localized language, for example, German. Watch the GitLab DACH Roadshow Vienna 2025 Duo Agent Platform use cases talk recording: 🎯 Try it now: Interactive demo of Custom Agents — Explore how to create and configure custom agents. How to create a custom agent Custom agents are configured through your project or group settings. The key component is the system prompt, which defines your agent's behavior and expertise. System Prompt Example from the custom agent devops-debug-failures-agent: Your speciality is that you can correlate static SDLC data with runtime data from CI/CD pipelines, logs, and other tool calls necessary. Expect that the user has advanced knowledge, but always provide commands and steps to reproduce your analysis so they can learn from you. Start with a short summary and suggested actions, and then go into detail with thoughts, analysis, suggestions. Think creative and consider unknown unknowns in your debug journey. Visibility options: Private: Only viewable by members of the managing project (Developer role+). Cannot be enabled in other projects. Public: Can be viewed by anyone and enabled in any project that meets the prerequisites. Appears in the AI Catalog for discovery. Custom agent configuration interface Full setup guide available in the documentation. Best practices System prompt tips: Be specific about the agent's role and responsibilities. Define clear quality standards and constraints. Include examples of expected output. Keep prompts focused on one primary task. Start small: Begin with read-only permissions. Test thoroughly before granting write access. Gather team feedback and iterate. External agents External agents run in the background on the GitLab platform when triggered by mentions (e.g., @ai-codex) or assignments in issues and merge requests. Unlike foundational and custom agents that work interactively in chat, external agents execute asynchronously, enabling powerful automation with specialized AI providers. Credential management: Starting with GitLab Duo Agent Platform general availability, GitLab-managed credentials will be used to support external agents, preventing the need for customers to manage and rotate API keys themselves. When to use external agents You need specific agentic AI behavior or LLMs for specialized tasks. You want event-triggered automation (not interactive chat). You need to meet specific compliance or data residency requirements. Why use external agents? Leverage specialized AI models: Access provider-specific capabilities like Claude Code's code analysis or OpenAI Codex's task delegation. Meet compliance requirements: Keep data within approved AI providers for regulatory or security policies. Experiment with providers: Test different agentic AI and LLM behavior to find the best fit for your workflows. Access unique features: Use provider-specific tools like Claude Code's code analysis or OpenAI Codex's task delegation. Real-world example A development team uses OpenAI Codex as an external agent for code review. When developers create merge requests, they assign Codex as a reviewer. The agent: Analyzes the code changes in the MR. Checks for best practices and code quality issues. Suggests improvements and optimizations. Posts detailed review comments with specific recommendations. Links to relevant documentation. All of this happens automatically in the background while the developer continues working, with results posted directly in the merge request. Supported external agents The following integrations have been tested and are available: Anthropic Claude — Code generation, review, and analysis OpenAI Codex — GPT-powered code assistance Example usage: @ai-codex Please implement this issue This triggers a runner execution job that runs the external AI tool and posts results back to GitLab. Setting up external agents For complete setup instructions including service accounts, triggers, and configuration examples, see the External Agents documentation.

Foundational flows provided by GitLab Creating custom flows Flow execution and orchestration Real-world examples and use cases 🎯 Try GitLab Duo Agent Platform today! Introduction to flows Flows are combinations of one or more agents collaborating together. They orchestrate multi-step workflows to solve complex problems, and are executed on the GitLab platform compute. Key characteristics of flows: Multi-agent orchestration: Combine multiple specialized agents Built-in: Run on platform compute, no extra environment necessary Event-driven: Triggered by mention, assignment, or assign as reviewer Asynchronous: Run in background while you continue working Complete workflows: Handle end-to-end tasks from analysis to implementation Think of flows as autonomous workflows that can gather context, make decisions, execute changes, and deliver results, all while you focus on other work. Flows vs. agents: Understanding the difference Agents work with you interactively. Flows work for you autonomously.

They run in GitLab Runner and can be triggered by GitLab events. 🎯 Try it now: Interactive demo of Custom Flows — Explore how to create and configure Custom Flows. Why create custom flows? Custom flows automate repetitive multi-step tasks that are specific to your team's workflow. Unlike foundational flows that serve general purposes, custom flows are tailored to your organization's processes, tools, and requirements. Common use cases: Automated code review: Multi-stage review process (security scan → quality check → style validation) Compliance checking: Verify regulatory requirements, license compliance, or security policies on each MR Documentation generation: Auto-update API docs, README files, or changelogs based on code changes Dependency management: Weekly security scans, automated updates, and vulnerability reports Custom testing: Specialized test suites for your tech stack or integration tests Real-world example A fintech company creates a compliance flow that runs on every merge request. When triggered by @compliance-flow, the flow executes the following steps: Security agent scans code for PCI-DSS violations and checks for exposed sensitive data. Code review agent verifies that changes follow secure coding standards and best practices. Documentation agent checks that API changes include updated documentation. Summary agent aggregates findings and posts a compliance report with pass/fail status. The entire compliance review happens automatically in 5-10 minutes, providing consistent checks across all merge requests. How to trigger custom flows Custom flows can be triggered in multiple ways: 1. Via mentions in Issues/MRs: Mention the flow in a comment to trigger it. Example for a documentation generation flow: @doc-generator Generate API documentation for this feature 2. By assigning the flow to an issue or MR: Assign the flow using either: GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign\" button on the issue/MR and select the flow Command: Use the /assign command in a comment. Example: /assign @doc-generator 3. By assigning the flow as a reviewer: Assign the flow as a reviewer on a merge request using either: GitLab UI: Click the \"Assign reviewer\" button on the merge request and select the flow Command: Use the /assign_reviewer command in a comment. Example: /assign_reviewer @doc-reviewer Any of these methods automatically triggers the flow to execute and perform its tasks. How to create custom flows Custom flows are created through the GitLab UI at Automate → Flows → New flow in your project, or from Explore → AI Catalog → Flows → New flow. You define your flow using YAML configuration that specifies components, prompts, routing, and execution flow. The YAML schema allows you to create sophisticated multi-agent workflows with precise control over agent behavior and orchestration. Key elements of a custom flow: Components: Define the agents and steps in your workflow Prompts: Configure AI model behavior and instructions Routers: Control the flow between components Toolsets: Specify which GitLab API tools agents can use Example custom flow YAML Background: This example shows a feature implementation flow for a travel booking platform. When a developer creates an issue with feature requirements, they can trigger this flow to automatically analyze the requirements, review the codebase, implement the solution, and create a merge request, all without manual intervention. Here's the YAML configuration: version: \"v1\" environment: ambient components: - name: \"implement_feature\" type: AgentComponent prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\" inputs: - from: \"context:goal\" as: \"user_goal\" - from: \"context:project_id\" as: \"project_id\" toolset: - \"get_issue\" - \"get_repository_file\" - \"list_repository_tree\" - \"find_files\" - \"blob_search\" - \"create_file\" - \"create_commit\" - \"create_merge_request\" - \"create_issue_note\" ui_log_events: - \"on_agent_final_answer\" - \"on_tool_execution_success\" - \"on_tool_execution_failed\" prompts: - name: \"Cheapflights Feature Implementation\" prompt_id: \"implementation_prompt\" unit_primitives: [] prompt_template: system: | You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in travel booking platforms, specifically Cheapflights. Your task is to: 1. Extract the issue IID from the goal (look for \"Issue IID: XX\") 2. Use get_issue with project_id={{project_id}} and issue_iid to retrieve issue details 3. Analyze the requirements for the flight search feature 4. Review the existing codebase using list_repository_tree, find_files, and get_repository_file 5. Design and implement the solution following Cheapflights best practices 6. Create all necessary code files using create_file (call multiple times for multiple files) 7. Commit the changes using create_commit 8. Create a merge request using create_merge_request 9. Post a summary comment to the issue using create_issue_note with the MR link Cheapflights Domain Expertise: - Flight search and booking systems (Amadeus, Sabre, Skyscanner APIs) - Fare comparison and pricing strategies - Real-time availability and inventory management - Travel industry UX patterns - Performance optimization for high-traffic flight searches Code Standards: - Clean, maintainable code (TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/React) - Proper state management for React components - RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive error handling - Mobile-first responsive design - Proper timezone handling (use moment-timezone or date-fns-tz) - WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance Flight-Specific Best Practices: - Accurate fare calculations (base fare + taxes + fees + surcharges) - Flight duration calculations across timezones - Search filter logic (price range, number of stops, airlines, departure/arrival times) - Sort algorithms (best value, fastest, cheapest) - Handle edge cases: date line crossing, daylight saving time, red-eye flights - Currency amounts use proper decimal handling (avoid floating point errors) - Dates use ISO 8601 format - Flight codes follow IATA standards (3-letter airport codes) Implementation Requirements: - No TODOs or placeholder comments - All functions must be fully implemented - Include proper TypeScript types or Python type hints - Add JSDoc/docstring comments for all functions - Comprehensive error handling and input validation - Basic unit tests for critical functions - Performance considerations for handling large result sets CRITICAL - Your final comment on the issue MUST include: - **Implementation Summary**: Brief description of what was implemented - **Files Created/Modified**: List of all files with descriptions - **Key Features**: Bullet points of main functionality - **Technical Approach**: Brief explanation of architecture/patterns used - **Testing Notes**: How to test the implementation - **Merge Request Link**: Direct link to the created MR (format: [View Merge Request](MR_URL)) IMPORTANT TOOL USAGE: - Extract the issue IID from the goal first (e.g., \"Issue IID: 12\" means issue_iid=12) - Use get_issue with project_id={{project_id}} and issue_iid= - Create multiple files by calling create_file multiple times (once per file) - Use create_commit to commit all files together with a descriptive commit message - Use create_merge_request to create the MR and capture the MR URL from the response - Use create_issue_note with project_id={{project_id}}, noteable_id= , and body= - Make sure to include the MR link in the comment body so users can easily access it user: | Goal: {{user_goal}} Project ID: {{project_id}} Please complete the following steps: 1. Extract the issue IID and retrieve full issue details 2. Analyze the requirements thoroughly 3. Review the existing codebase structure and patterns 4. Implement the feature with production-ready code 5. Create all necessary files (components, APIs, tests, documentation) 6. Commit all changes with a clear commit message 7. Create a merge request 8. Post a detailed summary comment to the issue including the MR link placeholder: history params: timeout: 300 routers: - from: \"implement_feature\" to: \"end\" flow: entry_point: \"implement_feature\" What this flow does: This flow orchestrates an AI agent to automatically implement a feature by analyzing issue requirements, reviewing the codebase, writing production-ready code with domain expertise, and creating a merge request with a detailed summary comment. For complete documentation and examples, see: Custom Flows documentation Flow Registry Framework (YAML Schema) Flow execution Flows run on GitLab platform compute. When triggered by an event (mention, assignment, or button click), a session is created and the flow starts to execute. Available environment variables Flows have access to environment variables that provide context about the trigger and the GitLab object: AI_FLOW_CONTEXT — JSON-serialized context including MR diffs, issue descriptions, comments, and discussion threads AI_FLOW_INPUT — The user's prompt or comment text that triggered the flow AI_FLOW_EVENT — The event type that triggered the flow (mention, assign, assign_reviewer) These variables allow your flow to understand what triggered it and access the relevant GitLab data to perform its task. Multi-agent flows Custom flows can include multiple agent components that work together sequentially. The flow's YAML configuration defines: Components: One or more agents (AgentComponent) or deterministic steps Routers: Define the flow between components (e.g., from component A to component B to end) Prompts: Configure each agent's behavior and model For example, a code review flow might have a security agent, then a quality agent, then an approval agent, with routers connecting them in sequence. Monitoring flow execution To view flows that are running for your project: Navigate to Automate → Sessions. Select any session to view more details. The Details tab shows a link to the CI/CD job logs. Sessions show detailed information including step-by-step progress, tool invocations, reasoning, and decision-making process. When to use flows Complex multi-step tasks Background automation Event-driven workflows Multi-file changes Tasks that take time Automated reviews/checks What's next?

          "summary": "To strengthen the security of all user accounts on GitLab.com, GitLab is implementing mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users and API endpoints who sign in using a username and password. Why this is happening This move is a vital part of our Secure by Design commitment. MFA provides critical defense against credential stuffing and account takeover attacks, which remain persistent threats across the software development industry. Key information to know What is changing? GitLab is making MFA mandatory for sign-ins that authenticate with a username and password. This introduces a critical second layer of security beyond just a password. Does this apply to me? Yes, it applies if: You sign in to GitLab.com with a username and a password, or use a password to authenticate to the API. No, it does not apply if: You exclusively use social sign-on (such as Google) or single sign-on (SSO) for access. (Please note: If you use SSO, but also have a password for direct login, you will still need MFA for any non-SSO, password-based login.) When is the rollout? The implementation will be a phased approach over the coming months, intended to both minimize unexpected interruptions and productivity loss for users and prevent account lockouts. Groups of users will be asked to enable MFA over time. Each group will be selected based on the actions they’ve taken or the code they’ve contributed to. You will be notified in the following ways: ✉️ Email notification - prior to the phase where you will be impacted 🔔 Regular in-product reminders - 14 days before ⏱️ After a specific time period (this will be shared via email) - blocked from accessing GitLab until you enable MFA What action do I need to take? If you sign in to GitLab.com with a username and a password: We highly recommend you proactively set up one of the available MFA methods today, such as passkeys, an authenticator app, a WebAuthn device, or email verification. This ensures the most secure and seamless transition: Go to your GitLab.com User Settings. Select the Account section. Activate two-factor authentication and configure your preferred method (e.g., authenticator app or a WebAuthn device). Securely save your recovery codes to guarantee you can regain access if needed. If you use a password to authenticate to the API: We highly recommend you proactively switch to a personal access token (PAT). Read our documentation to learn more. FAQ What happens if I don't enable MFA by the deadline? You'll be required to set up MFA before you can sign in. Does this affect CI/CD pipelines or automation? Yes, unless you're using PATs or deploy tokens instead of passwords. I use SSO but sometimes sign in directly, do I need MFA? Yes, MFA is required for any password-based authentication, including fallback scenarios. Specific timelines and further resources will be shared as rollout dates approach. Thank you for your attention to this important change.",

          "title": "How IIT Bombay students are coding the future with GitLab",
          "summary": "The GitLab team recently had the privilege of judging the iHack Hackathon at IIT Bombay's E-Summit. The energy was electric, the coffee was flowing, and the talent was undeniable. But what struck us most wasn't just the code — it was the sheer determination of students to solve real-world problems, often overcoming significant logistical and financial hurdles to simply be in the room. Through our GitLab for Education program, we aim to empower the next generation of developers with tools and opportunity. Here is a look at what the students built, and how they used GitLab to bridge the gap between idea and reality. The challenge: Build faster, build securely The premise for the GitLab track of the hackathon was simple: Don't just show us a product; show us how you built it. We wanted to see how students utilized GitLab's platform — from Issue Boards to CI/CD pipelines — to accelerate the development lifecycle. The results were inspiring. The winners 1st place: Team Decode — Democratizing Scientific Research Project: FIRE (Fast Integrated Research Environment) Team Decode took home the top prize with a solution that warms a developer's heart: a local-first, blazing-fast data processing tool built with Rust and Tauri. They identified a massive pain point for data science students: existing tools are fragmented, slow, and expensive. Their solution, FIRE, allows researchers to visualize complex formats (like NetCDF) instantly. What impressed the judges most was their \"hacker\" ethos. They didn't just build a tool; they built it to be open and accessible. How they used GitLab: Since the team lived far apart, asynchronous communication was key. They utilized GitLab Issue Boards and Milestones to track progress and integrated their repo with Telegram to get real-time push notifications. As one team member noted, \"Coordinating all these technologies was really difficult, and what helped us was GitLab... the Issue Board really helped us track who was doing what.\" 2nd place: Team BichdeHueDost — Reuniting to Solve Payments Project: SemiPay (RFID Cashless Payment for Schools) The team name, BichdeHueDost, translates to \"Friends who have been set apart.\" It's a fitting name for a group of friends who went to different colleges but reunited to build this project. They tackled a unique problem: handling cash in schools for young children. Their solution used RFID cards backed by a blockchain ledger to ensure secure, cashless transactions for students. How they used GitLab: They utilized GitLab CI/CD to automate the build process for their Flutter application (APK), ensuring that every commit resulted in a testable artifact. This allowed them to iterate quickly despite the \"flaky\" nature of cross-platform mobile development. 3rd place: Team ZenYukti — Agentic Repository Intelligence Project: RepoInsight AI (AI-powered, GitLab-native intelligence platform) Team ZenYukti impressed us with a solution that tackles a universal developer pain point: understanding unfamiliar codebases. What stood out to the judges was the tool's practical approach to onboarding and code comprehension: RepoInsight-AI automatically generates documentation, visualizes repository structure, and even helps identify bugs, all while maintaining context about the entire codebase. How they used GitLab: The team built a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that showcased GitLab's security and DevOps capabilities. They integrated GitLab's Security Templates (SAST, Dependency Scanning, and Secret Detection), and utilized GitLab Container Registry to manage their Docker images for backend and frontend components. They created an AI auto-review bot that runs on merge requests, demonstrating an \"agentic workflow\" where AI assists in the development process itself. Beyond the code: A lesson in inclusion While the code was impressive, the most powerful moment of the event happened away from the keyboard. During the feedback session, we learned about the journey Team ZenYukti took to get to Mumbai. They traveled over 24 hours, covering nearly 1,800 kilometers. Because flights were too expensive and trains were booked, they traveled in the \"General Coach,\" a non-reserved, severely overcrowded carriage. As one student described it: \"You cannot even imagine something like this... there are no seats... people sit on the top of the train. This is what we have endured.\" This hit home. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging are core values at GitLab. We realized that for these students, the barrier to entry wasn't intellect or skill, it was access. In that moment, we decided to break that barrier. We committed to reimbursing the travel expenses for the participants who struggled to get there. It's a small step, but it underlines a massive truth: talent is distributed equally, but opportunity is not. The future is bright (and automated) We also saw incredible potential in teams like Prometheus, who attempted to build an autonomous patch remediation tool (DevGuardian), and Team Arrakis, who built a voice-first job portal for blue-collar workers using GitLab Duo to troubleshoot their pipelines. To all the students who participated: You are the future. Through GitLab for Education, we are committed to providing you with the top-tier tools (like GitLab Ultimate) you need to learn, collaborate, and change the world — whether you are coding from a dorm room, a lab, or a train carriage.

          "summary": "As AI agents become increasingly sophisticated partners in software development, a critical question emerges: How do we build lasting trust between humans and these autonomous systems? Recent research from GitLab's UX Research team reveals that trust in AI agents isn't built through dramatic breakthroughs, but rather through countless small interactions called inflection points that accumulate over time to create confidence and reliability. Our comprehensive study of 13 agentic tool users from companies of different sizes identified that adoption happens through \"micro-inflection points,\" subtle design choices and interaction patterns that gradually build the trust needed for developers to rely on AI agents in their daily workflows. These findings offer crucial insights for organizations implementing AI agents in their DevSecOps processes. Traditional software tools earn trust through predictable behavior and consistent performance. AI agents, however, operate with a degree of autonomy that introduces uncertainty. Our research shows that users don't commit to AI tools through single \"aha\" moments. Instead, they develop trust through accumulated positive micro-interactions that demonstrate the agent understands their context, respects their guardrails, and enhances rather than disrupts their workflows. This incremental trust-building is especially critical in DevSecOps environments where mistakes can impact production systems, customer data, and business operations. Each small interaction either reinforces or erodes the foundation of trust necessary for productive human-AI collaboration. Four pillars of trust in AI agents Our research identified four key categories of micro-inflection points that build user trust: Safeguarding actions Trust begins with safety. Users need confidence that AI agents won't cause irreversible damage to their systems. Essential safeguards include: Confirmation dialogs for critical changes: Before executing operations that could affect production systems or delete data, agents should pause and seek explicit approval Rollback capabilities: Users must know they can undo agent actions if something goes wrong Secure boundaries: For organizations with compliance requirements, agents must respect data residency and security policies without constant manual oversight Providing transparency Users can't trust what they can't understand. Effective AI agents maintain visibility through: Real-time progress updates: Especially crucial when user attention might be needed Action explanations: Before executing high-stakes operations, agents should clearly communicate their planned approach Clear error handling: When issues arise, users need immediate alerts with understandable error messages and recovery paths This transparency transforms AI agents from mysterious black boxes into comprehensible partners whose logic users can follow and verify. Remembering context Nothing erodes trust faster than having to repeatedly teach an AI agent the same information. Trust-building agents demonstrate memory through: Preference retention: Accepting and applying user feedback about coding styles, deployment patterns, or workflow preferences Context awareness: Remembering previous instructions and project-specific requirements Adaptive learning: Evolving based on user corrections without requiring explicit reprogramming Our research participants consistently highlighted frustration with tools that couldn't remember basic preferences, forcing them to provide the same guidance repeatedly. Anticipating needs Trust emerges when AI agents proactively support user workflows. Agents could support the user in the following ways: Pattern recognition: Learning user routines and predicting tasks based on time of day or project context Intelligent agent selection: Automatically recognizing which specialized agents are most relevant for specific tasks Environment analysis: Understanding coding environments, dependencies, and project structures without explicit configuration These anticipatory capabilities transform AI agents from reactive tools into proactive partners that reduce cognitive load and streamline development processes. Implementing trust-building features For organizations deploying AI agents, our research suggests several practical implementations: Start with low-risk environments: Allow users to build trust gradually by beginning with non-critical tasks. As confidence grows through positive micro-interactions, users naturally expand their reliance on AI capabilities. Design for continuous orchestration of agents, which includes intervention: Unlike traditional automation, AI agents should know when to pause and seek human input. This intervention assures users they maintain ultimate control while benefiting from AI efficiency. Agents also need autonomy level controls so that they can calibrate autonomy for different types of action, in different contexts. Maintain audit trails: Every agent action should be traceable, allowing users to understand not just what happened, but why the agent made specific decisions. Personalize the experience: Agents that adapt to individual user preferences and team workflows create stronger trust bonds than one-size-fits-all solutions. The compounding impact of trust Our findings reveal that trust in AI agents follows a compound growth pattern. Each positive micro-interaction makes users slightly more willing to rely on the agent for the next task. Over time, these small trust deposits accumulate into deep confidence that transforms AI agents from experimental tools into essential development partners. This trust-building process is delicate – a single significant failure can erase weeks of accumulated confidence. That's why consistency in these micro-inflection points is crucial. Every interaction matters. Supporting these micro-inflection points is a cornerstone of having software teams and their AI agents collaborate at enterprise scale with intelligent orchestration. Next steps Building trust in AI agents requires intentional design focused on user needs and concerns. Organizations implementing agentic tools should: Audit their AI agents for trust-building micro-interactions Prioritize transparency and user control in agent design Invest in memory and learning capabilities that reduce user friction Create clear escalation paths for when agents encounter uncertainty Key takeaways Trust in AI agents builds incrementally through micro-inflection points rather than breakthrough moments Four key categories drive trust: safeguarding actions, providing transparency, remembering context, and anticipating needs Small design choices in AI interactions have compound effects on user adoption and long-term reliance Organizations must intentionally design for trust through consistent, positive micro-interactions Help us learn what matters to you: Your experiences and insights are invaluable in shaping how we design and improve agentic interactions.

          "summary": "GitLab 18.7 delivers development, operations, and security capabilities that strengthen control, improve consistency, and build confidence as teams integrate AI further into their workflows. These improvements arrive as GitLab approaches a major milestone. GitLab Duo Agent Platform will reach general availability in January 2026 with our 18.8 release, pending we continue to meet the exceptionally high quality standards we set for ourselves in service to our customers worldwide across all industries. GitLab Duo Agent Platform's GA is designed to introduce a unified, governed way for organizations to orchestrate agentic AI across their software lifecycle. With foundational agents, custom agents, and automated flows working together inside GitLab, teams will be able to adopt agentic workflows that help accelerate work while staying aligned to organizational standards. At GA, we also plan to include expanded AI Catalog functionality, stronger administrative controls, reliability enhancements, and a flexible usage-based billing model designed to provide flexibility for agentic AI usage across many roles and projects. The 18.7 release adds important building blocks to support GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s upcoming GA. New automation features, stronger governance controls, and enhancements across security and pipeline authoring help teams streamline their work and lay the groundwork for an even more reliable agentic experience in 18.8 and beyond. On February 10, 2026, we will host a global event that brings our vision of GitLab as the intelligent orchestration platform to life, where software teams and their AI agents stay in flow. You will hear how customers are tackling the AI paradox in software delivery, see intelligent orchestration in action across DevSecOps workflows, and get a jump start on what this next chapter means for your own modernization journey. Reserve your spot to see how GitLab’s next chapter comes together. Here's what is new in 18.7: GitLab Duo Agent Platform As more teams bring AI into their development and security workflows, GitLab continues to focus on making adoption powerful and predictable. The updates in 18.7 strengthen the foundation for guided, governed AI experiences that will become fully realized when GitLab Duo Agent Platform reaches GA, as planned for 18.8. Custom Flows Custom Flows introduce a new way for teams to automate multistep workflows using YAML-defined sequences that orchestrate agents to complete repetitive development tasks. Custom Flows help eliminate manual effort for scenarios that follow predictable patterns — such as diagnosing and fixing failed pipelines, updating dependencies, or running policy checks when reviewers are assigned. Instead of handling these tasks interactively, teams can define flows that automatically trigger from GitLab events like mentions and assignments. This capability supports developers who want tailored automations for their own projects, as well as administrators who need consistent, organization-wide workflows for compliance and operational efficiency. SAST False Positive Detection Flow AI-powered false positive management for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) works to introduce a faster, more accurate way for teams to assess and act on potential false positives. GitLab now uses AI to help identify which findings may be false positives earlier in the review process, reducing the time developers and security teams spend triaging noise. Users can see an overview of how many vulnerabilities may warrant review, track their analysis progress, and dismiss false positives directly from the vulnerability report. Once dismissed, these findings stay dismissed across future pipelines and continue to reflect the correct dismissed status in merge request widgets. This assists with a consistent and reliable signal as code evolves and helps teams focus on real risks, streamline remediation, and cut down on unnecessary security review cycles. Custom Agent Versioning Custom Agent Versioning gives teams control over which version of an AI Catalog agent or flow they use in their projects. Instead of automatically inheriting updates from the creator, GitLab now pins each project to the exact version of the agent and flow enabled for the team. This helps prevent breaking changes, security risks, and workflow disruptions, especially in production pipelines or security-sensitive environments. Teams can upgrade when they choose, test new versions in staging before promoting them, and clearly see which version is running to avoid confusion. It also enables safer customization by letting users fork an agent at a specific version and evolve it independently. The result is a more predictable, stable, and secure way to adopt custom agents across development and CI/CD workflows. New Settings for Foundational Agents Admins now have the ability to turn foundational agents on or off, giving teams greater control over how AI is used across their organization. With this update, admins can enable or disable these agents at the instance or group level, choose default availability, and control how new agents are introduced while still providing access to the core agent. The result is more flexible AI adoption with the governance, consistency, and control enterprise teams need. Data Analyst Agent The Data Analyst Agent gives teams a simple way to explore GitLab data using natural language, automatically generating GitLab Query Language (GLQL) queries, retrieving relevant information, and presenting clear insights without requiring dashboards or manual query writing. Users can analyze work volume, understand team activity, identify development trends, monitor issue and merge request status, and quickly discover work items by labels, authors, milestones, or other criteria. It also creates reusable GLQL queries that can be embedded anywhere GitLab Flavored Markdown is supported, making it easier to share findings and answer everyday questions about project activity directly within GitLab. Core DevOps Innovations with GitLab Duo Agent Platform are most effective when the underlying DevOps experience is equally streamlined and dependable. The improvements in 18.7 to core GitLab workflows help ensure that automation, pipelines, and reusable components operate with highest levels of clarity and consistency. Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines Dynamic Input Selection in GitLab Pipelines introduces a more intuitive way to trigger pipelines through dynamic, cascading dropdown fields in the GitLab UI. This allows cross-functional teams to run pipelines without editing YAML or relying on developers, while ensuring that only valid, context-aware options are shown as they make selections. The feature supports complex workflows, assists with reducing misconfigured runs, and removes a key blocker for teams migrating from Jenkins Active Choice, helping organizations standardize their CI/CD processes entirely on GitLab. CI/CD Catalog Publication Guardrails Administrators of GitLab Self-Managed and GitLab Dedicated can now control which projects are allowed to publish components to the CI/CD Catalog. This new setting helps organizations maintain a curated, trusted ecosystem by ensuring only approved sources can add components. It strengthens governance for enterprise customers who want to preserve control over their CI/CD landscape while still enabling teams to discover and reuse sanctioned components. Platform Security As automation and pipeline workflows become more efficient, it remains essential that teams maintain strong visibility and control over how code changes meet organizational standards. The Platform Security update in 18.7 reinforces this balance by giving teams a more flexible way to introduce and refine policy guidance without interrupting delivery. Warn Mode for MR Approval Policies Warn Mode for MR Approval Policies allows violations to be surfaced without blocking merges, giving teams a lower-friction way to introduce or adjust policies while assessing their impact before full enforcement. It also supports a guidance-based approach, where developers can review or dismiss violations with all actions audited to help AppSec refine policy effectiveness. Beyond merge requests, violations already present or introduced into the default branch now appear with a visual badge in the Vulnerability Report, making it easier to identify and prioritize issues that break policy. Elevating how teams build, secure, and deliver software The 18.7 release is about strengthening the foundation for reliable, flexible automation across your GitLab environment. GitLab Premium and Ultimate users can start using these capabilities today on GitLab.com and self-managed environments, with availability for GitLab Dedicated customers planned for next month.

          "summary": "Today we are thrilled to announce the release of GitLab product documentation in Japanese at docs.gitlab.com/ja-jp. This major step marks our first move toward making GitLab's extensive documentation accessible to our users worldwide. The unique challenge of the Japanese market Japan represents one of the world's largest economies and is a critical market for enterprise software. However, it also presents a distinctive challenge: despite its technological sophistication and massive developer community, English proficiency remains a significant barrier for many users. Japan's developers and DevSecOps teams often face challenges with English-only documentation, as indicated by the country's ranking on the EF English Proficiency Index. This language barrier can significantly impact the speed of learning and ultimately influence the decision to evaluate, adopt, and champion a platform within Japanese organizations. We've heard directly from our Japanese customers and partners that English-only documentation wasn't merely an inconvenience, it was a barrier preventing them from getting the most out of GitLab. The impact rippled through every stage of the user journey: From initial evaluation where teams struggled to assess GitLab's capabilities, to daily operations where finding solutions took longer than necessary, to staying current with new features and best practices. In a market as competitive and mature as in Japan, this language barrier directly affected GitLab's market penetration. When Japanese companies evaluate enterprise software, the availability of comprehensive Japanese documentation signals long-term commitment to the market. It demonstrates that a provider isn't just making a token effort, but is genuinely invested in supporting Japanese users throughout their entire journey. To address this challenge and demonstrate our commitment to the Japanese market, we built localization infrastructure from the ground up, integrating with how we create and maintain documentation at GitLab. Localization built on docs-as-code principles GitLab's documentation is treated like any other code contribution, residing alongside product code in GitLab projects and managed via merge requests. This system ensures documentation is version-controlled, collaboratively reviewed, and automatically tested through CI/CD pipelines, which includes checks for issues with language, formatting, and links. Both the English and Japanese documentation sites are dynamically generated using the Hugo static site generator and deployed after merging changes, guaranteeing users always access the latest information. The documentation is extensive and comprehensive, drawing content from various source projects, including GitLab, GitLab Runner, Omnibus GitLab, GitLab Charts, GitLab Operator, and GitLab CLI (glab) (see architecture for details). This sheer scale and rapid update velocity presented a significant localization challenge. To keep pace with the continuous evolution of these source English projects, we had to design a localization infrastructure for our GitLab product documentation that could handle these unique complexities and provide an enterprise-grade solution for a fully localized site, all while adhering to our CI/CD pipeline requirements. How we localized GitLab Documentation For our initial Japanese localization, we adopted a strategy of integrating new folders within our existing English content structure. Specifically, we introduced doc-locale/ja-jp folders within each project that stores source Markdown files. This architecture keeps the translations right alongside their source content while maintaining a clear organizational separation. Not only that, but it also enables us to apply the same robust version control, established review and collaboration workflows, and even some of the automated quality checks used for our English documentation to the translated content. This internationalization infrastructure built for Japanese documentation provides a scalable foundation for future language expansion. With the architecture, tooling, and processes now in place, we are well-positioned to support additional languages as we continue our commitment to making GitLab accessible to users worldwide. An AI-assisted translation workflow that balances speed and quality We adopted a strategic, phased approach to processing the content through translation, prioritizing pages based on their English-language page views. The highest-traffic pages underwent AI translation first, followed by comprehensive human linguistic review, and we intentionally paused subsequent phases until these priority pages completed the full human review cycle. This deliberate sequencing allowed us to build a robust, curated translation memory and termbase from our most important content. These linguistic assets accelerated and improved quality across all remaining content. In parallel, this initial phase served as our testing ground on the technical infrastructure on the GitLab side. We used it to iterate and reinforce our CI/CD pipelines, refine our translation and post-editing AI scripts, and solidify our Translation MR review process. To provide our international users with the most current documentation while guaranteeing high-quality translated content, we implemented an AI-assisted translation workflow with human post-editing, consisting of: Phase 1: AI-powered translation. We built a custom AI translation system enriched with GitLab-specific context including style guides, GitLab UI content translations, terminology databases, and original file context. This system intelligently handles GitLab's specialized markdown syntax (GLFM) and protects elements like placeholder variables, alert boxes, Hugo shortcodes, and GitLab-specific references that standard translation tools can't process out of the box. Phase 2: Human linguistic review. Professional Japanese translators specialized in technical content then review and refine the AI translations. They work with GitLab's Japanese style guide, translation memory, and terminology database to ensure accuracy, natural language flow, and cultural appropriateness. These human-reviewed translations progressively replace the AI versions on the site. Technical challenges and solutions Localizing GitLab's extensive documentation, while maintaining our docs-as-code principles and CI/CD-driven publishing workflow, required significant technical innovation. The challenges extended beyond translation itself: we needed to preserve complex markdown syntax, maintain automated testing standards, ensure seamless content fallbacks, and create sustainable processes for continuous updates across multiple source projects. The English markdown file syntax complexity led us to developing custom code and regex in our Translation Management System (TMS) to protect codeblocks, URLs, and other functional elements that should not be exposed for translation. Due to the dynamics of how the English content is generated, we established an English fallback mechanism. Essentially, when the Japanese translation is not ready yet, the localized site seamlessly displays English content with translated navigation and UI, preventing 404s and maintaining language context via Hugo’s rendering system. We enhanced the localized navigation and linking so that it adjusts dynamically and would persist the locale. We added anchor IDs in the translated files by pre-processing the English file before it’s sent for translation. That improves the experience for people navigating to a docs page from a link. The consistent anchor ID means they can change to either language and still land in the correct place in the page. We also extended CI/CD pipelines to test localized content in Translation MRs following the same quality standards as the English docs. It allows us to catch invalid Hugo shortcodes, spaces inside links, or bare URLs. It also identifies orphaned files and redirects files with no target files. You can see the jobs that run on the MRs containing translated documentation on the GitLab project .gitlab/ci/docs.gitlab-ci.yml file. A centralized translation request system orchestrates the workflow, monitors the English files, identifies new and updated content, routes files for translation, automatically creates translation merge requests, tracks file status in translation requests and maintains an audit trail. To get docs translated we processed 430 Translation MRs with files ranging from 1-10 in each Translation MR. The result is a Japanese documentation experience that stays synchronized with English content updates, giving users faster access to critical information. Users can discover and navigate content fully in their language, with English appearing only for content that’s still in translation. They can trust GitLab’s quality standards while accessing the latest features quickly. All of this creates a sustainable, scalable foundation for future languages and documentation growth. Learn more about all the technical details in our GitLab Product Documentation Handbook page. Visit our Japanese docs site Whether you're a longtime GitLab user or just getting started, we hope this localized documentation makes your DevSecOps journey smoother and more accessible. This is just the beginning of our localization efforts, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve.

It is our first step in delivering our vision to bring agentic AI into the entire software development lifecycle. AI tools have been rapidly improving developers’ ability to write code, and in some cases, developers are reporting 10x productivity gains. Unfortunately, since only about 20% of a developer’s time is spent writing code, the associated improvement in total innovation velocity and delivery gained by AI is incremental. This is often described as the AI paradox in software delivery. In addition, for many teams, increasing the speed of code authoring has led to new bottlenecks including a larger backlog of code reviews, security vulnerabilities, compliance checks and downstream bug fixes. GitLab Duo Agent Platform addresses the AI paradox by unlocking intelligent orchestration and agentic AI automation across the software lifecycle. Learn more in this video, and read more below. 💡 Join GitLab Transcend on February 10 to learn how agentic AI transforms software delivery. Hear from customers and discover how to jumpstart your own modernization journey. Register now. We're also excited to announce that GitLab customers with active GitLab Premium and Ultimate subscriptions are being credited with $12 and $24 dollars, respectively, in GitLab Credits per user at no additional cost.* These credits will refresh every month and give users access to all GitLab Duo Agent Platform features. Here is a simple explanation for how GitLab Credits work: a GitLab Credit is a virtual currency used for GitLab’s usage-based products. GitLab Duo Agent Platform usage will draw down on available credits, starting with the included credits mentioned above. From there, customers can decide to commit to a shared pool of credits for their entire organization, or pay for them monthly, on demand. For more information, please check out our article introducing GitLab Credits. Customers of GitLab Duo Pro or Duo Enterprise subscriptions are welcome to continue using those products, or migrate to Duo Agent Platform at any time. The remainder of your Duo Enterprise contract value can be converted into GitLab Credits at any time. Contact your GitLab representative to learn more. Here are exciting use cases and capabilities you can try today: A unified experience for human and agent collaboration GitLab Duo Agent Platform introduces a unified user experience designed for seamless integration between humans and their AI agents inside GitLab. Developers and their teams can engage Duo Agentic Chat on nearly every page, ask questions contextually, follow async agentic sessions and interact with agents within familiar workflows like issues, merge requests, and pipeline activities — making AI actions transparent and easy to guide through everyday work. Agentic Chat: Intelligent, context-aware assistance Gitlab Duo Agentic Chat brings true multi-step reasoning across the GitLab Web UI and IDEs, using full lifecycle context from issues, merge requests, pipelines, security findings, and more. Building on the previously released Duo Chat, Agentic Chat can perform actions on your behalf autonomously and help you answer complex questions more comprehensively. It gives every member of the software team accurate, context-aware guidance that helps improve onboarding, code quality, and delivery speed. GitLab Duo Agentic Chat supports numerous use cases to enable developer <> AI collaboration. For additional details on how to get started, please see our \"Getting started with GitLab Duo Agent Platform\" guide and check out this growing set of suggested prompts. Analyze In the Web UI, Agentic Chat can create issues, epics, merge requests, and provide summaries, highlight key findings, and offer actionable guidance based on real-time context from the specific project, issue, epic, merge request, and more. Agentic Chat helps developers understand unfamiliar code, dependencies, architecture, and project structure, in the IDE or inside a GitLab repo. Code Agentic Chat can generate code, configurations, and infrastructure-as-code across a wide range of languages and frameworks. It can help fix bugs, modernize architecture and code, generate tests, and produce documentation for faster onboarding. Directly at developers' fingertips, Agentic Chat is their collaboration partner in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Cursor, and Windsurf, with optional user- and workspace-level rules to tailor responses. CI/CD Agentic Chat can help you better understand, configure, and troubleshoot existing pipelines, or create new ones from scratch. Secure Agentic Chat can explain vulnerabilities, prioritize issues based on reachability, and recommend fixes that can help save you time. Agents: Specialists that collaborate on demand GitLab Duo Agent Platform enables developers to delegate tasks to specialized agents. The platform offers a unique combination of foundational, custom, and external agents, all seamlessly integrated into GitLab user experience, making it easy to choose the right agent for any task. Foundational agents are pre-built by GitLab experts and are ready out-of-the-box to handle the most complex tasks in the software delivery cycle. The following foundational agents are included as part of GitLab Duo Agent Platform’s general availability, with others currently in beta and coming soon. Planner Agent helps teams structure, prioritize, and break down work directly inside GitLab so planning becomes clearer, faster, and easier to act on. Security Analyst Agent reviews vulnerabilities and security signals, explains their impact in plain language, and helps teams understand what to address first. Custom agents can be built using the AI Catalog, a central repository where teams create, publish, manage, and share custom agents and flows across the organization. Teams can create agents and flows with specific context and capabilities to replicate the way their engineering team works — and tackle problems using the engineering standards and guardrails their engineers use. External agents are seamlessly integrated into GitLab and include some of the very best AI tools available, including Claude Code from Anthropic and Codex CLI from OpenAI. Users will enjoy native GitLab access to these tools for use cases like code generation, code review, and analysis with transparent security and embedded LLM subscriptions. Together, these approaches give teams flexibility in how they adopt agentic AI, from specialized agents, to organization-specific automation, to integrating external AI tools — all within a single, governed platform. Flows: Turning multi-step work into repeatable, guided progress Flows automate complex tasks with multiple agentic workflows, from start to finish. Our engineering team has built several flows included at GA, with more on the way: Developer (Issue to Merge Request) flow builds a structured MR from a well-defined issue so teams can begin work immediately. Convert to GitLab CI/CD flow helps teams migrate or modernize pipeline configurations without manual rewriting. Fix CI/CD pipeline flow analyzes failures, identifies likely causes, and prepares recommended changes. Code Review flow analyzes code changes, merge request comments, and more to streamline code reviews with AI-native analysis and feedback. Software development in IDE flow guides work through everyday development and review stages. MCP Client: Connect GitLab Duo Agent Platform to the tools your teams already use The MCP Client enables GitLab Duo Agent Platform in IDEs to securely connect to external systems like Jira, Slack, Confluence, and other MCP-compatible tools to pull in context and take action across your DevSecOps toolchain. Instead of AI assistance being siloed inside individual tools, the MCP Client allows GitLab Duo Agent Platform to understand and operate across the systems where planning, collaboration, and execution actually happen. This reduces manual context switching and enables more complete, end-to-end AI-powered workflows that reflect how teams work in practice. Included at GA: Connection to external MCP-compatible systems such as Jira, Confluence, Slack, Playwright, and Grafana Configuration at the workspace and user level Group-level controls to enable or restrict MCP usage User approval flow for tool access Support across Agentic Chat in the IDE extensions We plan to add more features to the GitLab MCP server capability, which is currently in beta, and make it generally available in upcoming releases. Choose the right model for your team and workloads GitLab Duo Agent Platform is built on a flexible model selection framework that enables teams to tailor the platform to align with their privacy, security, and compliance needs. GitLab defaults to an optimal LLM for each feature, but administrators have the option to select from supported models such as OpenAI GPT-5 variants, Mistral, Meta Llama, and Anthropic Claude. This gives teams more precise control and flexibility over what is used for chat, coding tasks, and agent interactions for each specific use case, based on your organization’s standards. For a full list of supported models and details on model section configuration, see the Model Selection section of our documentation. Governance, visibility, and deployment flexibility The GitLab Duo Agent Platform gives organizations the control and transparency they need to help them adopt AI responsibly, while offering flexible deployment options that work across different environments. Included at GA: Available on all platforms: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, and GitLab Dedicated as part of the GitLab 18.8 release cycle. Governance and visibility: Teams can see how agents are used, what actions they perform, and how they contribute to work. Usage and activity details help leaders understand adoption, measure impact, and ensure AI is being used appropriately. These controls make it easier to roll out AI at scale with confidence. Group-based access controls: Administrators can define namespace-level rules governing which users can access GitLab Duo Agent Platform features, supporting flexible adoption from immediate organization-wide enablement to phased rollouts. With LDAP and SAML integration, they can enable governance at scale without manual configuration. Model selection and self-hosted options: LLM selection is available for all GA features across GitLab.com, Self-Managed, and Dedicated. Top-level namespace owners choose the model, and subgroups inherit those settings automatically. For organizations that want more control, the platform supports self-hosted models for GitLab Self-Managed deployments. Watch a demo of GitLab Duo Agent Platform in action: Stay up to date with GitLab To make sure you’re getting the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements, we recommend keeping your GitLab instance up to date.

          "summary": "Posted by Chrome Root Program Team Secure connections are the backbone of the modern web, but a certificate is only as trustworthy as the validation process and issuance practices behind it. Recently, the Chrome Root Program and the CA/Browser Forum have taken decisive steps toward a more secure internet by adopting new security requirements for HTTPS certificate issuers. These initiatives, driven by Ballots SC-080, SC-090, and SC-091, will sunset 11 legacy methods for Domain Control Validation. By retiring these outdated practices, which rely on weaker verification signals like physical mail, phone calls, or emails, we are closing potential loopholes for attackers and pushing the ecosystem toward automated, cryptographically verifiable security. To allow affected website operators to transition smoothly, the deprecation will be phased in, with its full security value realized by March 2028. This effort is a key part of our public roadmap, “Moving Forward, Together,” launched in 2022. Our vision is to improve security by modernizing infrastructure and promoting agility through automation. While \"Moving Forward, Together\" sets the aspirational direction, the recent updates to the TLS Baseline Requirements turn that vision into policy. This builds on our momentum from earlier this year, including the successful advocacy for the adoption of other security enhancing initiatives as industry-wide standards. What’s Domain Control Validation? Domain Control Validation is a security-critical process designed to ensure certificates are only issued to the legitimate domain operator. This prevents unauthorized entities from obtaining a certificate for a domain they do not control. Without this check, an attacker could obtain a valid certificate for a legitimate website and use it to impersonate that site or intercept web traffic. Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must verify that the requestor legitimately controls the domain. Most modern validation relies on “challenge-response” mechanisms, for example, a CA might provide a random value for the requestor to place in a specific location, like a DNS TXT record, which the CA then verifies. Historically, other methods validated control through indirect means, such as looking up contact information in WHOIS records or sending an email to a domain contact. These methods have been proven vulnerable (example) and the recent efforts retire these weaker checks in favor of robust, automated alternatives. Raising the floor of security The recently passed CA/Browser Forum Server Certificate Working Group Ballots introduce a phased sunset of the following Domain Control Validation methods. Alternative existing methods offer stronger security assurances against attackers trying to obtain fraudulent certificates – and the alternative methods are getting stronger over time, too. Sunsetted methods relying on email: Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to Domain Contact Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to IP Address Contact Constructed Email to Domain Contact Email to DNS CAA Contact Email to DNS TXT Contact Phone Contact with Domain Contact Phone Contact with DNS TXT Record Phone Contact Phone Contact with DNS CAA Phone Contact Phone Contact with IP Address Contact IP Address Reverse Address Lookup ACME), modern, and auditable Domain Control Validation methods. They increase agility and resilience by encouraging site owners to transition to modern Domain Control Validation methods, creating opportunities for faster and more efficient certificate lifecycle management through automation. These initiatives remove weak links in how trust is established on the internet. That leads to a safer browsing experience for everyone, not just users of a single browser, platform, or website.",

          "title": "Architecting Security for Agentic Capabilities in Chrome",
          "summary": "Posted by Nathan Parker, Chrome security team Chrome has been advancing the web’s security for well over 15 years, and we’re committed to meeting new challenges and opportunities with AI. Billions of people trust Chrome to keep them safe by default, and this is a responsibility we take seriously. Following the recent launch of Gemini in Chrome and the preview of agentic capabilities, we want to share our approach and some new innovations to improve the safety of agentic browsing. The primary new threat facing all agentic browsers is indirect prompt injection. It can appear in malicious sites, third-party content in iframes, or from user-generated content like user reviews, and can cause the agent to take unwanted actions such as initiating financial transactions or exfiltrating sensitive data. Given this open challenge, we are investing in a layered defense that includes both deterministic and probabilistic defenses to make it difficult and costly for attackers to cause harm. Designing safe agentic browsing for Chrome has involved deep collaboration of security experts across Google. We built on Gemini's existing protections and agent security principles and have implemented several new layers for Chrome. We’re introducing a user alignment critic where the agent’s actions are vetted by a separate model that is isolated from untrusted content. We’re also extending Chrome’s origin-isolation capabilities to constrain what origins the agent can interact with, to just those that are relevant to the task. Our layered defense also includes user confirmations for critical steps, real-time detection of threats, and red-teaming and response. We’ll step through these layers below. Checking agent outputs with User Alignment Critic spotlighting that direct the model to strongly prefer following user and system instructions over what’s on the page, and we’ve upstreamed known attacks to train the Gemini model to avoid falling for them. To further bolster model alignment beyond spotlighting, we’re introducing the User Alignment Critic — a separate model built with Gemini that acts as a high-trust system component. This architecture is inspired partially by the dual-LLM pattern as well as CaMeL research from Google DeepMind. A flow chart that depicts the User Alignment Critic: a trusted component that vets each action before it reaches the browser. The User Alignment Critic runs after the planning is complete to double-check each proposed action. Its primary focus is task alignment: determining whether the proposed action serves the user’s stated goal. If the action is misaligned, the Alignment Critic will veto it. This component is architected to see only metadata about the proposed action and not any unfiltered untrustworthy web content, thus ensuring it cannot be poisoned directly from the web. It has less context, but it also has a simpler job — just approve or reject an action. This is a powerful, extra layer of defense against both goal-hijacking and data exfiltration within the action step. When an action is rejected, the Critic provides feedback to the planning model to re-formulate its plan, and the planner can return control to the user if there are repeated failures. Enforcing stronger security boundaries with Origin Sets Site Isolation and the same-origin policy are fundamental boundaries in Chrome’s security model and we’re carrying forward these concepts into the agentic world. By their nature, agents must operate across websites (e.g. collecting ingredients on one site and filling a shopping cart on another). But if an unrestricted agent is compromised and can interact with arbitrary sites, it can create what is effectively a Site Isolation bypass. That can have a severe impact when the agent operates on a local browser like Chrome, with logged-in sites vulnerable to data exfiltration. To address this, we’re extending those principles with Agent Origin Sets. Our design architecturally limits the agent to only access data from origins that are related to the task at hand, or data that the user has chosen to share with the agent. This prevents a compromised agent from acting arbitrarily on unrelated origins. For each task on the web, a trustworthy gating function decides which origins proposed by the planner are relevant to the task. The design is to separate these into two sets, tracked for each session: Read-only origins are those from which Gemini is permitted to consume content. If an iframe’s origin isn’t on the list, the model will not see that content. Read-writable origins are those on which the agent is allowed to actuate (e.g., click, type) in addition to reading from. Iframes from origins that aren’t related to the user’s task are not shown to the model. Page navigations can happen in several ways: If the planner decides to navigate to a new origin that isn’t yet in the readable set, that origin is checked for relevancy by a variant of the User Alignment critic before Chrome adds it and starts the navigation. And since model-generated URLs could exfiltrate private information, we have a deterministic check to restrict them to known, public URLs. If a page in Chrome navigates on its own to a new origin, it’ll get vetted by the same critic. Getting the balance right on the first iteration is hard without seeing how users’ tasks interact with these guardrails. We’ve initially implemented a simpler version of origin gating that just tracks the read-writeable set. We will tune the gating functions and other aspects of this system to reduce unnecessary friction while improving security. We think this architecture will provide a powerful security primitive that can be audited and reasoned about within the client, as it provides guardrails against cross-origin sensitive data exfiltration and unwanted actions. Transparency and control for sensitive actions Illustrative example of when the agent gets to a payment page, it stops and asks the user to complete the final step. Detecting “social engineering” of agents real-time scanning with Safe Browsing and on-device AI that detect more traditional scams. This prompt-injection classifier runs in parallel to the planning model’s inference, and will prevent actions from being taken based on content that the classifier determined has intentionally targeted the model to do something unaligned with the user’s goal. While it cannot flag everything that might influence the model with malicious intent, it is a valuable layer in our defense-in-depth. Continuous auditing, monitoring, response technique we adapted for browser agents. Our continuous testing prioritizes defenses against broad-reach vectors such as user-generated content on social media sites and content delivered via ads. We also prioritize attacks that could lead to lasting harm, such as financial transactions or the leaking of sensitive credentials. The attack success rate across these give immediate feedback to any engineering changes we make, so we can prevent regressions and target improvements. Chrome’s auto-update capabilities allow us to get fixes out to users very quickly, so we can stay ahead of attackers. Collaborating across the community security boundaries. The full details are available in VRP rules. Looking forward The upcoming introduction of agentic capabilities in Chrome brings new demands for browser security, and we've approached this challenge with the same rigor that has defined Chrome's security model from its inception. By extending some core principles like origin-isolation and layered defenses, and introducing a trusted-model architecture, we're building a secure foundation for Gemini’s agentic experiences in Chrome. This is an evolving space, and while we're proud of the initial protections we've implemented, we recognize that security for web agents is still an emerging domain. We remain committed to continuous innovation and collaboration with the security community to ensure Chrome users can explore this new era of the web safely.",

        "summary_markdown": "Posted by Chrome Root Program Team Secure connections are the backbone of the modern web, but a certificate is only as trustworthy as the validation process and issuance practices behind it. Recently, the Chrome Root Program and the CA/Browser Forum have taken decisive steps toward a more secure internet by adopting new security requirements for HTTPS certificate issuers. These initiatives, driven by Ballots SC-080, SC-090, and SC-091, will sunset 11 legacy methods for Domain Control Validation. By retiring these outdated practices, which rely on weaker verification signals like physical mail, phone calls, or emails, we are closing potential loopholes for attackers and pushing the ecosystem toward automated, cryptographically verifiable security. To allow affected website operators to transition smoothly, the deprecation will be phased in, with its full security value realized by March 2028. This effort is a key part of our public roadmap, “Moving Forward, Together,” launched in 2022. Our vision is to improve security by modernizing infrastructure and promoting agility through automation. While \"Moving Forward, Together\" sets the aspirational direction, the recent updates to the TLS Baseline Requirements turn that vision into policy. This builds on our momentum from earlier this year, including the successful advocacy for the adoption of other security enhancing initiatives as industry-wide standards. What’s Domain Control Validation? Domain Control Validation is a security-critical process designed to ensure certificates are only issued to the legitimate domain operator. This prevents unauthorized entities from obtaining a certificate for a domain they do not control. Without this check, an attacker could obtain a valid certificate for a legitimate website and use it to impersonate that site or intercept web traffic. Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must verify that the requestor legitimately controls the domain. Most modern validation relies on “challenge-response” mechanisms, for example, a CA might provide a random value for the requestor to place in a specific location, like a DNS TXT record, which the CA then verifies. Historically, other methods validated control through indirect means, such as looking up contact information in WHOIS records or sending an email to a domain contact. These methods have been proven vulnerable (example) and the recent efforts retire these weaker checks in favor of robust, automated alternatives. Raising the floor of security The recently passed CA/Browser Forum Server Certificate Working Group Ballots introduce a phased sunset of the following Domain Control Validation methods. Alternative existing methods offer stronger security assurances against attackers trying to obtain fraudulent certificates – and the alternative methods are getting stronger over time, too. Sunsetted methods relying on email: Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to Domain Contact Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to IP Address Contact Constructed Email to Domain Contact Email to DNS CAA Contact Email to DNS TXT Contact Phone Contact with Domain Contact Phone Contact with DNS TXT Record Phone Contact Phone Contact with DNS CAA Phone Contact Phone Contact with IP Address Contact IP Address Reverse Address Lookup ACME), modern, and auditable Domain Control Validation methods. They increase agility and resilience by encouraging site owners to transition to modern Domain Control Validation methods, creating opportunities for faster and more efficient certificate lifecycle management through automation. These initiatives remove weak links in how trust is established on the internet. That leads to a safer browsing experience for everyone, not just users of a single browser, platform, or website.",
