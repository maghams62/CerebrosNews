          "Title: Google One: More storage and Google AI in one subscription",
          "I’ve been paying *$125&#x2F;mo* (promo pricing for the $250&#x2F;mo tier) for Google’s top-tier &quot;AI Ultra&quot; subscription for a month. I signed up because I’m a power user—I manage large repos, build my own MCP tools, and live in the terminal. I assumed &quot;Ultra&quot; meant &quot;Pro Developer.&quot; I was wrong. I downgraded to the $20&#x2F;mo plan today, and here is why other developers should probably avoid the top tier. 1. The &quot;Double Pay&quot; Paradox The subscription gives you the Web UI (Gemini Advanced) and 30TB of storage. It gives you zero API credits. If you use modern AI coding tools like Aider , Cursor , or your own scripts, you have to pay per-token for the API separately. * *My Bill:* $125&#x2F;mo for the subscription + ~$50&#x2F;mo for API usage. * *The Reality:* I was effectively donating $125&#x2F;mo to Google for a Web UI I barely use because I’m working the CLI. *2. The &quot;Official&quot; CLI is Broken (The 400 Error)* I tried to use the official `gemini-cli` to avoid the API costs. It is unusable for agentic work. There is a known, persistent bug where the CLI crashes with a `400 Bad Request` error whenever the model attempts parallel tool calling (a standard feature of the model). * *The Bug:* `Please ensure that the number of function response parts is equal...` * Issues like #11925 (Broken Auth) and #13292 (Parallel Tool Crash) have been open for months. * [Auth Bug: Issue #11925]( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google-gemini&#x2F;gemini-cli&#x2F;issues&#x2F;11925 ) * [Tool Crash: Issue #13292]( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google-gemini&#x2F;gemini-cli&#x2F;issues&#x2F;13292 ) *3. Shipping the Org Chart* The reason the pricing makes no sense is that Google is clearly shipping its Org Chart. * *Google One* wants to sell Storage (hence the 30TB bundle). * *Google Cloud* wants to sell APIs (Vertex). * *DeepMind* wants to ship Models. The &quot;Ultra&quot; plan is a Franken-product stitched together by the Storage team. They don&#x27;t have a billing mechanism for &quot;Individual Developer who needs API credits,&quot; so they force you to buy a data center&#x27;s worth of hard drives instead. *4. The Feedback Black Hole* The most frustrating part is that there is no way to get this feedback to a human who can actually change it. You can&#x27;t file a ticket for &quot;Your pricing model ignores developers.&quot; You just scream into the void of the feedback form. *The Solution: Unbundle the Intelligence* We need a *&quot;Developer Tier&quot;*: * *Give me:* High API Rate Limits + API Credits. * *Charge me:* Fairly for what I use. Until then, I’ve downgraded to the standard $20&#x2F;mo plan and I&#x27;m moving the rest of my AI budget to anthropic."

          "iro-cuda-ffi is a small, stable bridge that lets Rust programs call CUDA C++ kernels that are built ahead of time with NVIDIA’s own toolchain (nvcc). It’s designed for teams who already have CUDA code, or want to keep writing it in standard .cu files, and still drive it safely from Rust. That means you can keep using familiar NVIDIA tooling like Nsight and cuda-gdb, and you don’t have to rewrite or wrap kernels as strings or scripts at runtime. What makes it different is the approach: it doesn’t do runtime compilation or a Rust‑specific GPU language; it uses the same nvcc‑compiled CUDA C++ you already have. That keeps the existing CUDA code and tests intact, while giving Rust a clean, minimal ABI to launch kernels with. The result is a straightforward way to reuse NVIDIA‑optimized code paths inside Rust without changing your CUDA workflow."

          "Hi HN, I’ve spent the last few months debugging a pattern I kept seeing on client sites: Ads are running, tags are installed, dashboards look fine — but Google Ads conversions are missing, inconsistent, or silently degraded. In most cases, the problem wasn’t the conversion tag itself. It was consent timing: tracking scripts firing before consent cookies set before consent Consent Mode v2 present but misconfigured conversion events firing before consent updates These setups often “look” correct in GTM or DevTools, but behave differently for a real first-time visitor. So I built a small scanner that loads a site like a new user would and checks: what scripts fire before consent whether cookies are set pre-consent whether Consent Mode v2 is actually configured whether conversions would fire after consent The output is a technical report with detected issues and suggested fixes (mostly small configuration changes). This is not a compliance&#x2F;legal tool — it’s meant as a debugging aid for people working with Google Ads, GA4, and consent setups. I’m sharing it here mainly for feedback from people who’ve dealt with consent&#x2F;tracking edge cases, false positives, or odd GTM behavior. Happy to answer technical questions or explain how detection works."

          "I used to play warhammer when I was younger and am honestly astounded gamesworkshop is still in business let alone one of Britain&#x27;s biggest companies. At least in the 00s and 2010s, they were the epitome of a greedy corporation squeezing blood from a stone. Sales were down? Increase the prices of everything. Something not selling well? Change the game rules to make that it more powerful (or conversely, hype it up constantly so people only realize it sucks after they buy it). And of course constant changes so it was likely any models you bought would eventually become uncompetitive due to new, flashier, more overpowered things released. Basically every bad business practice we see now was Games Workshop&#x27;s wheelhouse. And while this may come across as bashing on them, I&#x27;m psyched to hear the company is thriving because their games are immensely fun and its impressive they&#x27;ve avoided stagnating or run out of ideas. It gives me hope for the software industry because if an in-person, expensive niche hobby could survive through social media and the pandemic, tech can bounce back from the current enshitification and short-term profit seeking. If you have the money and enjoy lots of lore&#x2F;worldbuilding and complex strategy games, Warhammer is a fantastic hobby I&#x27;d recommend checking out"

          "Hi HN, I&#x27;m the solo founder behind Bountisphere. I find Zero-Based Budgeting (like YNAB) fails at handling Time: specifically in understanding cash flow&#x2F;running balance not only today but next week, next month, next year. I find this approach creates a great ease knowing that the Money Plan you put in place is actually working right now AND into the future. So, I built Bountisphere to focus on running balance forecasting instead of category tracking (though we do that too secondarily). Would love any and all feedback on the approach! Thanks!!",
          "The rearview mirror analogy is spot on. Traditional budgeting tells you what happened, cash flow forecasting tells you when you&#x27;ll actually hit the wall. The tricky bit is handling irregular income and timing uncertainty. Are you modeling confidence intervals or just point estimates? Most forecasting tools I&#x27;ve seen fall apart when income isn&#x27;t predictable - would be curious how you&#x27;re approaching that."

          "Hi HN, We’ve been integrating AI coding agents deeply into our development workflows and saw major gains once we let agents run in long loops (tests → build → search → refine). The problem: to be effective, agents need real access to the environment. Our first approach was allowing agents to run bash. It works, but it’s obviously dangerous — arbitrary commands, no guardrails, and a lot of implicit trust. OpenCuff is our attempt to fix this. It’s an open-source tool that gives AI coding agents explicit, capability-based access instead of raw shell execution. Agents can run useful actions (tests, builds, searches, etc.) while staying within well-defined, auditable boundaries. The goal is to let agents run autonomously for hours without turning your machine or CI environment into a free-for-all. This is an early, fast-moving project. We built it for ourselves, but we think others running AI agents at scale may run into the same tradeoffs. We’d really appreciate feedback from the HN community — especially around: threat models we may be missing comparisons to sandboxing &#x2F; containers &#x2F; policy-based systems what you’d want from a tool like this Links: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencuff.ai https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenCuff&#x2F;OpenCuff Happy to answer questions and discuss design decisions."

          "The persistent discrepancy between the proton charge radius measured from muonic hydrogen ($r_p \\approx 0.84 \\text{ fm}$) and electronic hydrogen ($r_p \\approx 0.88 \\text{ fm}$)—the &quot;proton radius puzzle&quot;—suggests a potential violation of lepton universality or an incomplete understanding of vacuum structure at short distances. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of \\textbf{nonlinear vacuum metric response}. By treating the vacuum as a dielectric-like medium with a finite elastic modulus coupled to electromagnetic energy density, we derive a conformal scaling factor for the local metric. The contraction of the effective metric is analytically derived as $\\eta = \\alpha \\ln(m_\\mu&#x2F;m_e)$, where the coupling factor arises from the summation over vacuum polarization modes. This formula yields a radius shrinkage of \\textbf{3.8906\\%}, which agrees with the experimental discrepancy of \\textbf{3.9115\\%} to within \\textbf{0.02\\%}. We further predict a radius of \\textbf{0.823 fm} for tauonic hydrogen."

          "I built this while working as an AWS Solutions Architect. I kept seeing the same problem - DevOps teams would hand over architecture diagrams that were months out of date, or worse, just wrong compared to what was actually deployed. They were maintaining diagrams manually in draw.io, updating them whenever infrastructure changed. Which meant they were perpetually out of date. That&#x27;s not a good use of anyone&#x27;s time. When I explored what auto diagramming tools were out there, they either needed access to state files or cloud accounts (not always possible in security-conscious environments), or produced basic dependency graphs rather than proper diagrams with VPC and subnet groupings. Terravision reads your Terraform HCL directly, runs entirely client-side with no credentials required, and can slot into a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline so your docs update themselves after every deployment. Feedback welcome - what would make this more useful?"

          "Built an email signature manager called Firma (which means &quot;signature&quot; in Spanish) as a side project after seeing everyone at my company used a different email signature despite sharing an html signature with them and asking to just complete with their own data. For those who use Google Workspace, you can connect your account and install the email signature you designed in Firma to your team with 1 click. Happy to hear your thoughts, feedback and suggestions :) Thanks! cristian@tryfirma.com"

There have been incidents in academia of researchers accepting funds from the US government for projects and also accepting money from foreign governments but not disclosing it.

To this day I use AM for pushing packets around the property. There&#x27;s no doubt standard radio broadcasters are an awesome way to pick up where the usual networks fall down."

This analysis ignores the issue of negative side effects. The most serious, rhabdomyolysis, occurs in about 0.1% of those taking statins. Liver issues are more common, and the cost of monitoring that might affect the cost&#x2F;benefit ratio. It would be nice to have a next generation statin that didn&#x27;t have the muscle side effect (which appears to be independent of the primary mode of action of statins.)"

He wrote last month: &quot;Using her elevated position as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Machado may well have tipped the balance in favour of war, facilitated by the named suspects.&quot; I find it funny that what many saw as a terrible decision has now come to pass, and the Nobel Institute is scrambling to save face. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;wikileaks&#x2F;status&#x2F;2001260159432290686",

Actor–observer asymmetries in expressing and evaluating sociopolitical neutrality.&quot; - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psycnet.apa.org&#x2F;doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001835 Abstract: &quot;Opposing someone on a contentious sociopolitical issue often prompts criticism and conflict. People may be tempted to reduce such acrimony by expressing neutrality. Across 11 studies with North American samples, we find that, although people commonly express neutrality on controversial issues, observers are skeptical of others’ neutrality, judging them as similarly moral as those who oppose them those who explicitly oppose them. Unpacking lay beliefs about why people express neutrality sheds light on this disjunction between responses to the neutral self versus the neutral other. Specifically, people render more favorable attributions for their own neutrality (e.g., true indecision) than do observers (e.g., apathy, strategic behavior). Therefore, while neutrality is an often-invoked strategy to manage impressions, it is unlikely to succeed in doing so.&quot;"

I have open-sourced the fine-tuned models on Hugging Face and am looking for feedback on false positives&#x2F;negatives in real-world scenarios. The main exploration has been ablations based on freezing certain layers of the transformers. More work could be explored by tuning other parameters and expanding the datasets. The Models: • Image (ViT-B&#x2F;16): Fine-tuned Vision Transformer achieving 91.9% Accuracy and 0.99 AUC. o Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;acaciabengo&#x2F;nsfw_image_detection • Text (DistilBERT): Binary classifier trained on ~200k samples. o Focus: Optimized for low-latency inference (&lt;100ms) to fit into real-time chat streams. o Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;acaciabengo&#x2F;nsfw_text_detection How to try it: 1. Self-Host (Free): You can pull the weights directly from Hugging Face and run them in your own container. 2. Managed API (Freemium): I have deployed these exact models as a high-availability API on RapidAPI. There is a free tier for testing. RapidAPI I am very interested in feedback on: • Performance • Access to larger datasets • Shared experience from people who have handled similar tasks Thank You"

Version 2.5 is now out, and it’s the first release that feels “complete” enough for real projects. Core ideas: simple, modern syntax Rust‑inspired performance model built‑in tools for AI workflows (embeddings, similarity, pipelines) flow‑based execution with automatic rollback auto‑docs and auto‑tests via decorators cross‑platform installers (Win&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;macOS) Example: velin @Flow fn checkout(user, cart) { validate(user) reserve(cart) charge(user, cart) } If you’re into new languages, API design, or AI‑driven backends, I’d love feedback.

Honestly, never had to think about refresh tokens, the client should take care of that for you. \n\nI would pick an IDP every time over building it. Before picking Keycloak, I would also suggest evaluating Authentik. They’re very similar, but with slight differences (Authentik has built in support for SCIM, Keycloak requires third-party plugins for SCIM). Many cloud IDPs give really generous low-cost/free tiers that are definitely worth considering."

          "Hydrate: AI chat for Obsidian that can actually edit your notes I built Hydrate because I wanted Cursor-style AI assistance in my notes, not just a chatbot bolted onto the sidebar. What it does: You chat with an AI that can read, edit, and create files across your vault. Drag in a note for context, ask it to restructure your project docs, or have it extract todos from meeting notes into your task list. The free tier is actually usable. Core features—chat, file operations, semantic search, slash commands—all work with your own API keys. No markup, no usage limits from us. Paid features I actually use daily: Image input (Pro, $10&#x2F;mo): I photograph whiteboard sketches and book pages, drop them into chat, and ask Hydrate to transcribe or summarize into my notes. Sounds small, but it&#x27;s changed how I capture ideas. MCP integrations (Pro): Connect external tools. I have it pulling context from our internal docs API during planning sessions. Custom views (Max, $20&#x2F;mo): This one&#x27;s wild. Describe what you want—&quot;show my recipes as cards grouped by cuisine&quot;—and it generates a React view on the spot. I built a project dashboard in about 3 minutes of back-and-forth. Views hot-reload as you iterate. If you like using Obsidian daily, I hope you will love using Hydrate. It&#x27;s an Obsidian plugin. Install from Community Plugins or grab it at hydrateagent.com. Happy to answer questions about the architecture or how specific features work."

Point 2 doesn&#x27;t tackle the reasons why there is a mismatch between in-memory representation and tabular data. Some benefits include the wins obtained from a schema built to utilize &quot;normal form&quot;. Object databases have their place, but so do fully normalized database tables. Point 3 doesn&#x27;t strike me as useful. I don&#x27;t find myself reverting rows to previous points in history that often, if I ever have. Tracking versions of rows is useful. I would argue that &quot;reverting&quot; is not, since the reverting would be better tracked by adding a new version as a forward update. Overall, sure, a new, &quot;light weight&quot;, object database that uses data structures* may have a place somewhere. But to replace SQLite?

          "Hi HN, I’m the creator of zsweep. It’s a keyboard-centric Minesweeper clone where you play entirely using Vim motions (h, j, k, l to move; w&#x2F;b to skip words; etc.). The Backstory: I wanted to build a project to get my hands dirty with Svelte 5 and the new Runes system. I also wanted a way to practice Vim muscle memory that wasn&#x27;t just typing code. Tech Stack: Frontend: Svelte 5 (Runes) + SvelteKit Styling: Tailwind CSS State: Custom Finite State Machine (FSM) for the game logic The Challenge: One of the hardest parts was getting the &quot;chording&quot; logic right (where you clear multiple squares at once) while keeping the keyboard navigation feeling instant and &quot;vim-like.&quot; It’s open source, so if you’re curious about how Svelte 5 handles game state, feel free to poke around the code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oug-t&#x2F;zsweep I’d love to hear your feedback on the controls or any edge cases you find!",

It’s designed for LLM prompts &#x2F; RAG contexts where you want something more structured than token masking: you can define “features” as tokens, sentences, paragraphs, tools, images, or arbitrary fields, pin “permanent” context that should always be included (e.g., system prompt + question), and compute attributions with options like caching and multi-threading to speed up the many model calls. Repo + tutorial are here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;filipnaudot&#x2F;llmSHAP https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filipnaudot.github.io&#x2F;llmSHAP&#x2F;tutorial.html I’d love feedback on if you think this could be genuinely useful in your LLM workflows (prompt engineering, RAG debugging, evals, guardrail auditing, etc.)?",

          "Hi HN, I’m Emilie (Em’ on GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whispem ). My background is in literature and linguistics – I spent most of my pre-2025 life far away from computers. I really started programming in January 2025 through the Apple Foundation Program, where I learned Swift, UI&#x2F;UX design, and how to build basic iOS apps—even though everything felt new and visual at first! That playful intro made me realize I could actually learn to code, so I kept pushing my limits. Since October 27th, 2025, I’ve been diving deep into Rust and systems development, building projects as a way to understand storage engines, distributed systems, and even the basics like command-line tools. I was even invited to give a talk about my learning journey and beginner perspective at Epitech Marseille on December 16th, 2025, which was an amazing (and slightly terrifying) experience! My approach is always “learn by building” – no formal CS background, just a lot of note-taking, self-challenges, reading docs, and sharing code&#x2F;experience in public. If you’re curious about how a non-traditional background can be (sometimes!) an advantage for learning technical skills, or if you’re coming to Rust&#x2F;systems from outside tech, I wrote down my full path and lessons learned here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whispem&#x2F;minikv&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;LEARNING.md Always happy to connect, share tips for nontraditional learners, or just chat about the joys and headaches of learning Rust and low-level systems from scratch. You can find everything (good and bad!) on my GitHub profile. – Em’"

          "I don&#x27;t think it has ever been the case that you could neglect soft skills. You will hear this over and over, in every area of every business: people become successful by adjusting their behaviour to what works for the business. Sometimes this is called being a slick politician, sometimes it is called avoiding getting bogged down in politics. But it&#x27;s never been the case that a dev could just focus on technical things and not spend any time figuring out the context they are working in, and behaving accordingly. My first day of work, this is what my boss said to me: &quot;Look at this trading floor. There&#x27;s screens everywhere, everything is numbers. Deltas, gammas, vegas. Everything is calculated by computers. But don&#x27;t forget, every business is a people business!&quot;",
          "This has never been the case for those of us doing consulting, soft skills are a must have requirement when dealing with customers on regular basis.",
          "I&#x27;ve heard this &quot;soft skills are the only skills that matter&quot; thing throughout my entire career but these days this is indeed greatly amplified. Our CEO started sharing screenshots of his xitter&#x2F;linkedin feeds and most of them contain wisdoms like &quot;Opus 4.5 is better than 90% of talent&quot;. There is also longer form business fan fiction. It usually follows this template: there is a hero - a humble manager&#x2F;sales person, and a villain - a cocky, nerdy software developer. The villain claims that some task is impossible or takes months to complete. Then the humble hero (equipped with Opus 4.5) completes the task in 2 hours. The villain is then humiliated&#x2F;fired and everyone lives happily ever after. These posts definitely contribute to the declining morale among employees. Nobody goes &quot;above and beyond&quot; anymore - we just strictly doing the tickets and nothing more."

          "Hello HN, maker here. I built StackForge because I was tired of the &quot;Day 1&quot; problem: setting up Auth, Stripe, Prisma, and Docker configurations for every new SaaS idea. Most low-code tools lock you into their ecosystem. I wanted an &quot;accelerator&quot; that outputs standard, clean code that I can eject and host anywhere. The Stack: - Frontend: React 19 + Vite 7 (Tailwind) - Backend: Node.js + Express 5 - ORM: Prisma (with auto-generated schemas) - DB: PostgreSQL (via Docker Compose) The interesting technical challenge was handling business rules safely. Instead of using LLMs to write execute-only code (which is dangerous), I use Llama 3 to translate natural language rules into &quot;JSON Logic&quot;. This creates a portable logic layer that runs on both the Frontend (for instant UI feedback) and Backend (for Zod validation), without using eval(). It is currently in Public Beta. The output is a standard ZIP file. I would love your feedback on the generated folder structure and the developer experience."

It&#x27;s absolutely getting more homogeneous. The music that wins awards is a particular subset of music and is far from representative of the music scene overall. Commercial music is absolutely getting worse according to my own preferences, but there is as much new excellent, high-quality music around as ever. It&#x27;s just not the stuff that is topping streaming charts or winning Grammys.",

The actual &quot;advantage&quot; of the present songs I noticed in the video is, that after the few seconds I pretty well know the song already, which wouldn&#x27;t work with &quot;Thriller&quot; or &quot;Beat it&quot;. Since then, they &quot;streamlined&quot; not only the harmonics, but also the melodies, and it becomes harder every year to tell these songs apart. I assume we require Northcote Parkinson&#x27;s theory to explain why these much simpler songs require ten times more composers than the much more complex songs from the eighties."

          "This is an excellent breakdown of a subtle but critical modeling problem. The analogy to event-driven architectures is spot on. We face a structurally similar challenge in investment simulation, but with time-series data. A user&#x27;s portfolio is the central hub (&quot;event broker&quot;), and historical market events (drawdowns, volatility spikes, earnings) are the producers&#x2F;consumers. If we model relations naively, we lose which specific historical regime caused a given rule violation. Our solution aligns with your &quot;Solution 1: More specificity&quot;: we pre-compute and tag regime-specific metrics (e.g., &quot;max drawdown during 2020 Q1&quot;, &quot;volatility during 2018 Fed hikes&quot;). This allows the engine to answer &quot;why was this stock excluded?&quot; with a precise historical scenario, not just a generic violation. Question: In your experience, is there a performance&#x2F;readability trade-off threshold where adding this specificity (like your firewall rules or our regime tags) becomes counterproductive for the diagram (or system) comprehension?"

          "Hey HN, I’m the maker of LayoutCraft. I built this because I was frustrated with the current state of AI image generation. I found myself spending hours re-rolling prompts just to get the text spelled correctly or to fix a layout that looked &quot;slightly off.&quot; The issue is that diffusion models generate pixels, which makes them inherently probabilistic—if you ask to change a text the whole image is regenerated. LayoutCraft takes a different approach. Instead of guessing pixels, I built a rendering pipeline that uses LLMs to write HTML and CSS, which is then rendered via Playwright. This makes the output deterministic. It means the text is actual DOM text (always crisp), the layouts respect specific hex codes for brand consistency, and you can resize the same design state to different aspect ratios instantly without artifacts. It’s definitely not for generating &quot;art&quot; or photorealistic scenes, but for structured marketing assets where layout consistency matters, I found this workflow much more reliable. I’d love to hear your feedback on the approach!"

If you are running out of time, cut the scope for the initial delivery. Do not extend the time.\n\nThis is just shooting your own foot in the long run no? I've seen many books argue that just finishing a task isn't enough and you need to allocate something like 10% of your task time to go beyond so technical debt does not accumulate. Setting aggressive deadlines is the best way to hack things together without thinking of the future",

What was the original source of this? What is \"deep focus\"? I would say I can regain my focus after a minor interruption in about 1 minute. In my experience the exaggeration of how harmful interruptions are leads to lack of communication in teams which is typically much more damaging. Of course there's a limit, if you get interrupted every 5 minutes then you're not going to get much done. But I think it's overstated."

Had to implement fallbacks for Firefox and Safari users (they don&#x27;t fully support it yet).

The permission model is also interesting - users have to explicitly grant access, which builds trust but adds friction to UX. Worth it though. What are you using it for?"

          "I built this tool to explore Linux capabilities and privilege escalation vectors. In version 1.1, I’ve achieved a major personal goal: completely removing the libcap dependency. To keep the tool truly standalone and portable, I replaced the library with a custom implementation using native Linux syscalls (capget&#x2F;capset). My core philosophy is &quot;zero-bloat&quot;: no malloc (everything is stack-based or static to ensure stability), zero external dependencies, and a minimal footprint. Every byte in the binary must be justified. The backstory: due to limited hardware access, I developed and debugged this entire update directly on my smartphone. This constraint forced me to be a more disciplined architect, ensuring the code is as efficient as possible. It now compiles and runs out-of-the-box on x86, ARM, and other architectures without needing any extra system headers. I hope you find it useful for your audits or learning—whatever your goals may be"

          "I built finite because setting up Pi-hole + Unbound felt unnecessarily complex for something that should be &quot;flash and forget.&quot; The problem: Most guides have you SSH in, run scripts, edit config files, and hope nothing breaks on reboot. Every update risks drift. The solution: One declarative Nix flake. Clone, tweak settings.nix, build the SD image, boot. Your DNS stays local, ads get blocked, and the entire config is version-controlled. Tech: NixOS 25.11, Pi-hole 6.2.1, Unbound 1.23.1. Works on Pi 3B+ and newer. Blog deep-dive: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wh1le.com&#x2F;finite Curious what the community thinks about declarative home infra."

          "Hi everyone, I’ve been working on a small side project called IOU Wallet and it would be great to find out if you think its useful and useable. Let me explain in some more detail: How IOU Wallet Works IOU Wallet helps you keep track of everyday peer-to-peer obligations. It is designed for real-world situations where something is borrowed, a service is provided, or money is owed, and both sides want clarity without relying on formal contracts. At its core, an IOU records who owes what to whom, under which conditions, and when the obligation is considered settled. Both parties acknowledge the IOU through a simple virtual handshake, and once settlement is confirmed a closing handshake settles the obligation. IOU Wallet supports three types of IOUs: Items, Services, and Cash. Each can start simple and be extended with additional terms when needed. Item IOUs (Borrowed Things) Basic example A friend borrows your book. You create an IOU that records the item. Your friend accepts it. When the book is returned, settlement is initiated and confirmed and the IOU is completed. With a rate You lend a camera for a week. A small daily rental rate is agreed. The rate accrues over time, starting either when the IOU is accepted or after the agreed return date. With redemption You lend equipment that may not be returned. Instead of returning the item, the borrower can settle the IOU by paying an agreed redemption value. If a rate applies, it is added on top of that value. Settlement Settlement can happen off-platform — for example when a book is returned, a service is completed, or cash is handed back directly. For outstanding monetary obligations, IOU Wallet also provides on-platform I click settlement, with integrations to selected providers and support for multiple currencies. We currently Support USD, EUR, GBP and Solana. You can also settle fiat using crypto if enabled by the counterparty IOUs recorded through IOU Wallet are underwritten by personal integrity through virtual handshakes and are not legally enforceable We are doing a soft launch and would really appreciate feedback on: whether the mental model makes sense confusing wording or flows edge cases you think I’ve missed Happy to answer questions and look forward to your feedback — I hope this tool is useful for you."

He even pushed for the mechanical override, meant to be used in such emergencies, to be hidden Did anyone catch the source for this? I hadn&#x27;t heard this detail before. EDIT: I found a source[0], but that characterization is pretty misleading. The article even say that in internal discussions, &quot;Musk wasn’t alone in pushing for electric controls.&quot; All it says about Musk is that pushed for &quot;virtually everything&quot; to be electric, but it doesn&#x27;t say he pushed anything about the door manual release (you know they&#x27;d include that in the article if they could).

          "I mostly agree, but I would have agreed with a similar article 10 years ago, and that would have been a fairly widely held opinion (e.g. Bill Gates was famously short Tesla). So I wouldn’t be so sure as this piece is in Tesla’s downfall, and the emotive language doesn’t help this look like an objective analysis. I also don’t like articles that take the industry consensus or expert opinion as a priori the correct opinion. Tesla wasn’t built by consensus; even the door handle example that is here touted as a negative almost certainly helped Tesla more than its harmed by being one of many unique features.",

          "OP here. This is an experiment to replace standard RNN&#x2F;Transformer attention mechanisms with a geometric control-theory approach. The core idea is a &quot;Pilot&quot; (pointer) that physically navigates a 1D Riemann Helix based on gradient flux. We treat learning as a physics problem involving Inertia, Friction (Deadzone), and Stochastic Walk. It behaves like a quantum system where the particle location (training state) and the wave function (inference state) have de-synced. The code is raw, manual CUDA. Looking for feedback on the inertia logic and if anyone has seen this specific &quot;Shell vs. Core&quot; divergence before."

          "Bigocheck is a zero‑dependency tool for empirical Big‑O complexity analysis in Python. It runs your Python function across different input sizes, measures runtime and memory usage, and fits the results against common complexity classes. The project ships as both a library and a CLI and focuses on being “zero‑ops” — you can pip install bigocheck and start profiling without extra dependencies. Key features: Time complexity: fits results to nine complexity classes (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(n³), O(2ⁿ), O(n!)) and can detect arbitrary polynomial O(n^k) terms. Space complexity: classifies memory usage into complexity classes. Git commit tracking &amp; regression detection: track complexity across commits and detect regressions. Instability detection: detect noisy&#x2F;unreliable benchmarks; supports confidence scoring and p‑values to validate results. Badge &amp; report generation: create SVG badges for READMEs and generate HTML&#x2F;Markdown reports automatically. Jupyter&#x2F;CI integration: rich HTML displays in notebooks, optional Matplotlib plotting, CSV&#x2F;JSON export, and integration with pytest and GitHub Actions. Benchmark options: specify sizes, trials, warmup runs, best&#x2F;worst&#x2F;average cases, async functions, amortized analysis, parallel benchmarking, and A&#x2F;B comparison of two implementations. User‑friendly CLI: full command‑line interface (bigocheck run, bigocheck regression, bigocheck repl, etc.) with an optional REPL for quick analysis. Bigocheck is released under the MIT license on GitHub and is available on PyPI. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are welcome! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;bigocheck&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adwantg&#x2F;bigocheck"

          "Hi HN, I&#x27;m a developer and a father of two. I built LinxMemo because standard contact apps (flat lists) are terrible at modeling the &quot;many-to-many&quot; relationships inherent in school environments. In a school setting, you don&#x27;t just know a person; you know a &quot;graph&quot; in a family unit (e.g., Alice is Bob&#x27;s mom + Charlie&#x27;s wife + usually picks up on Tuesdays). The Problem: I kept forgetting parents&#x27; names at pickups. I needed a way to query &quot;Who are the parents of this child?&quot; instantly, without navigating through complex notes or creating messy duplicates in my main Contacts app. The Solution: LinxMemo links contacts into Families and Groups using a graph-like structure. - Data Model: It links entities (Parents, Children) bi-directionally. - Privacy: It is strictly local-first. All data resides on the device. No signup required, no ads. It&#x27;s currently in public beta via TestFlight. I&#x27;d love feedback on the UI and must-have feature requests. TestFlight: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflight.apple.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;9UVTzxtP Thanks!"

          "I never understood the Handmade Network. AFAIU, it came from people who watched Casey Muratori&#x27;s Handmade Hero, a game developed on video over several years from scratch. But Casey, as far as I know, didn&#x27;t start the Network and it never seemed to align with the intent of Handmade Hero. The purpose of Handmade Hero was to show people that they are capable of making a game themselves and to learn things which have a reputation for being too hard. There was, of course, an emphasis on the hard things being hard because of complexity introduced by things like OOP, C++, etc. But the main purpose always felt like education and enablement. Casey&#x27;s a great teacher and the videos are very informative. The Network, on the other hand, was some weird &quot;we want to make stuff by hand&quot;, whatever that means. That&#x27;s fine. But that&#x27;s not what Casey spent like 7 years doing. He didn&#x27;t do it &quot;just cuz&quot;. Instead, it was to teach and share. That seemed lost on the Network. As a result, it seemed just like a less toxic Suckless project without the focus on making a new ecosystem. It was just a forum to say, &quot;Hey I made this thing&quot;, all the while co-oping the feel-goods from Casey&#x27;s Handmade Hero.",
          "&gt;What will the Foundation do? &gt;The number one goal of the Handmade Software Foundation is to support, promote, and sustain the development of Handmade software. I would love some concrete ideas what this means. My primary concern is that if any money is involved, like stipends for handmade software it will be gamed and there is no way to monitor if LLMs are used or not. In current world it is hard for me not to be cynical when I heard about new good thing, but also they are asking for money and they don’t really tell what they will do with it",

Despite advancing several rounds in the NIST competition and being close to advancing to the final round, ***they were both broken completely, and even classically so-a classic attacker with a commercial laptop can break the schemes in a relatively short time.*** These examples are a good reminder that “modern” and “standardized” are not always synonyms for “secure”.\n\n...to \"future-proof\" my systems against an attack methodology which, if the current rate of research \"success\" continues, may be able to break encryption at the same speed as current computers can, [in about 2,000 years:](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/17/quantum_cryptanalysis_criticism/)\n\n&gt; drew a line through the two PQC data points we have which indicate that we'd get to the same level of code breaking that we have today with standard computers in about 2,000 years' time, but even those data points are from sleight-of-hand factorizations, not legitimate applications of Shor's algorith\n\nWell, ***if*** we ever get past the state of actually factorizing arbitrary numbers as opposed to [specifically chosen numbers only](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/17/quantum_cryptanalysis_criticism/#:~:text=%22Quantum%20factorization%20is%20performed%20using%20sleight%2Dof%2Dhand%20numbers%20that%20have%20been%20selected%20to%20make%20them%20very%20easy%20to%20factorize), which currently we don't, so currently the line doesn't point to \"in 2,000 years\", it points to infinity.\n\n----\n\nIn summary, everyone who still believes that quantum cryptanalysis is a real threat, should really read this:\n\nhttps://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/bollocks.pdf\n\nAnd this:\n\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf"

          "Hi HN! I built FragCut to solve a problem I had as a streamer: spending hours editing highlight clips from my gaming sessions. FragCut uses AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to analyze your gaming videos and automatically: - Detect highlight moments (clutches, multi-kills, funny moments) - Convert them to 9:16 vertical format for TikTok&#x2F;Shorts&#x2F;Reels - Add auto-generated captions and hashtags - Process everything in the cloud (no software to install) Upload a video, and get 5-6 viral-ready clips in about 15 minutes. Currently focused on FPS games (Valorant, CS2, Apex) but works with any gaming content. Would love feedback from the HN community!",

Drivers whose eyeballs are monitored by AI cameras that do phenology on their faces to figure out when went to dock their pay and warehouse workers whose bodies are ruined in a matter of months.

          "I&#x27;ve been using Claude Code heavily for months. It&#x27;s great for velocity, but I kept hitting the same problems: - Agent hallucinates file paths that don&#x27;t exist - Claims &quot;tests pass&quot; without running them - Same errors recurring across sessions - No way to catch failures that aren&#x27;t crashes The tools exist to catch crashes. Nothing exists to catch semantic failures - when the agent confidently gives wrong answers. So I built Task Orchestrator - an MCP server that adds an &quot;immune system&quot; to Claude Code: 1. Semantic failure detection - catches hallucinations, not just crashes 2. ML-powered learning - remembers failure patterns, warns before similar prompts 3. Human-in-the-loop - queues high-risk operations for approval 4. Cost tracking - see exactly what you&#x27;re spending 5. Self-healing circuit breakers The math problem: at 95% per-step reliability, a 20-step workflow has only 36% success rate. That&#x27;s not a bug - it&#x27;s compound probability. Technical details: - 680+ tests - Provider-agnostic (works with any LLM) - MCP native for Claude Code - MIT licensed What features would you want to see that would improve your AI agent workflows?"

Since the data is available on the dashboard, I wrote a tool to extract it directly. It uses browser_cookie3 to read the active session from the local browser and curl_cffi to bypass Cloudflare&#x2F;WAF protections. It effectively treats the web dashboard as an API endpoint. The tool includes a setup command (waybar-ai-usage setup) that automatically injects the module and styles into your Waybar config (creating a backup first), so no manual JSON editing is required. I also packaged the dependencies on AUR to make it a one-liner install for Arch users."

          "A few years ago (possibly around the same time as the author), I also took up running and was gifted a Garmin from a running friend of mine. He also recommended an app called TrainAsOne, a running scheduled that did&#x2F;does an AI&#x2F;ML and poops put a constantly adjusting scheduled for you. The first three weeks were great, but boy howdy TAO was pushing me fairly hard. “That’s fine, I’m young (32), I can do it!” I could not. Fourth week I get hit with massive runners knee and I’m out for a few months. The app couldn’t know this was going to happen, I’ve got pretty bad knees genetically, but my dedication to the EXACT specifications of each outing determined by the model was absolute, and to my detriment. The same friend who gifted me the watch told me to go slow, short runs, build the endurance, but the app differed, so who did I trust more? I digress. I’ve since cancelled the app, and I’m back running for a few years, all while managing the injury. Like the author, I’ll be tackling the Berlin Marathon in September. But my training is now done on my own terms. I’m guided by some external advice, but unwavering acceptance of an app to what I do with my body is not something I want to try again. I still track all my runs, but all I do is start the watch, and go for a run. It doesn’t beep at me to go faster or slower, it just shuts its mouth while I move forward. All that aside, I can’t help but do the maths on my monthly volume to ensure I’m hitting bigger and bigger milestones. Thank god the watch is counting it for me ;)",
          "Good lord the reveal at the end seemed mistimed.",
          "&gt;My watch takes walking, cycling and running seriously — especially outside rather than on a treadmill — but a hard session at the gym barely registers. It will count my steps for me, but I have to count my own pull-ups The Strava of weight training (not _counting_ the pull-ups for you, but recording them, helping you build workouts, track progress, social sharing) is the well-named Hevy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hevyapp.com"

          "OP here. I built this project because I am fascinated by the Yarrow Stalk method—a process that is complex and full of ritual. While most apps are just &quot;click and get answer,&quot; my implementation requires the user to click over 100 times to complete the ritual. I originally hesitated to add AI because AI demands speed, whereas this ritual represents slowness. After a month of observation, the results have been surprising: 1. I see users completing these 100+ clicks every day, far exceeding my expectations. 2. Users have left comments on the site specifically asking me NOT to add AI. 3. I also received strong validation for this &quot;sacred friction&quot; strategy from the Indie Hackers community. This has been really encouraging. It seems people are craving the &quot;process&quot; more than just the result. I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on this.",
          "I had Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 3 do a Tarot reading for me given what their memory systems know about me and was underwhelmed but I that just may be Tarot, which I&#x27;m not familiar with. More interesting was when I asked them to tell me which character I most resemble in the folowing: The Wire, The Sopranos, Better Call Saul&#x2F;Breaking Bad and the game of Chess. Both said I was Freeman in The Wire, Hesch in The Sopranos, Mike in Breaking Bad and a Knight in chess. I asked them to explain their reasoning, which was enlightening from a self-knowledge perspective.",
          "clicking a hundred times is annoying. I think you could automate the yarrow picking so I follow along visually instead of clicking. otherwise, cool. and I agree AI has no place in an app like this."

          "Hey HN! I built MetaXuda after getting tired of &quot;buy Windows for ML&quot; advice when working on Apple Silicon. Problem: Most ML libraries (XGBoost, scikit-learn) are CUDA-only with zero macOS GPU support. Existing translation layers (ZLUDA) add overhead. Solution: Native Rust + Metal runtime from scratch. Key features: - 1.1 TOPS throughput (95% of M1 theoretical peak) - Tokio async scheduler with zero race conditions - Multi-tier memory: GPU → RAM → SSD (handles 100GB+ workloads) - 230+ GPU ops (math, transform, ML primitives) - CUDA-style APIs for easy library integration - Bypasses Numba execution path Technical approach: - No CUDA&#x2F;ZLUDA reuse (licensing + perf reasons) - PyO3 wrapper for Python - Arrow-based quantization in-kernel - 93.37% GPU cap to prevent macOS starvation Known limitations: - Metal stream limits still undocumented by Apple - CUDA API coverage incomplete (in progress) - Some blocking favors stability over raw speed pip install metaxuda Open to questions on Metal vs CUDA architecture, Rust async patterns, or Apple GPU quirks. Also looking for feedback on scheduler design. License inquiries: p.perinban@gmail.com"

The point is, not to have contrast with surroundings. Kindle, or the text consoles on older CRT monitors looked good because they were not too bright against the surroundings. And the content on the screen felt like real-world tangible object. Having said that, I feel that dark mode (full dark) is a product of &quot;new is exciting&quot;, &quot;game theme&quot;, &quot;dark means serious, mystery, suspense&quot;, &quot;no glaring&quot;, &quot;linux&#x2F;console style, so geek&quot;, &quot;we are coders, so different from normal people&quot; etc The reality is, full dark theme requires more brightness and more power consumption.

          "I agree with what&#x27;s written, and I&#x27;ve been talking about the harm seemingly innocuous anthropomorphization does for a while. If you do correct someone (a layperson) and say &quot;it&#x27;s not thinking&quot;, they&#x27;ll usually reply &quot;sure but you know what I mean&quot;. And then, eventually, they will say something that indicates they&#x27;re actually not sure that it isn&#x27;t thinking. They&#x27;ll compliment it on a response or ask it questions about itself, as if it were a person. It won&#x27;t take, because the providers want to use these words. But different terms would benefit everyone. A lot of ink has been spilled on how closely LLM&#x27;s approximate human thought, and maybe if we never called it &#x27;thought&#x27; to begin with it wouldn&#x27;t have been such a distracting topic from what they are -- useful.",
          "&gt; &quot;Cognition&quot; has a meaning. It&#x27;s not vague. In psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy of mind, cognition refers to mental processes in organisms with nervous systems. Except if you actually look up the definitions, they don&#x27;t mention &quot;organisms with nervous systems&quot; at all. Curious.",
          "This framing makes sense. What we call “AI thinking” is really large-scale, non-sentient computation—matrix ops and inference, not cognition. Once you see that, progress is less about “intelligence” and more about access to compute. I’ve run training and batch inference on decentralized GPU aggregators (io.net, Akash) precisely because they treat models as workloads, not minds. You trade polished orchestration and SLAs for cheaper, permissionless access to H100s&#x2F;A100s, which works well for fault-tolerant jobs. Full disclosure: I’m part of io.net’s astronaut program."

          "Hey folks, Title, mostly. I&#x27;d wager most of us know what debugging is already, and a solid chunk of us have at least some hands-on experience using debuggers in any given language. &quot;AI Debugger&quot; exposes familiar debugging capabilities to agents through an MCP interface. Think operations like: - Breakpoints (basic breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logpoints, etc.) - Stepping (into, over, out of) - Inspection (locals, globals, call stack, single stack frame, etc.) I built it using the debugger components VS Code already uses (mainly debug adapters) to ensure reusability and a 100% open source codebase. These are the key features I&#x27;ve shipped with `0.1.1`: - VS Code `launch.json` support. Your launch configs in this file can be used to launch `aidb` sessions. Helpful for cross-team sharing, complex debug entry points, or just familiar VS Code workflows. - Remote debugging. I was able to debug worker nodes in a Dockerized Trino cluster, meaning you can attach to remote ports and debug huge codebases remotely. Seems potentially useful for any sort of remote debugging or CI integration. - An extensible core API, built around the &quot;debug adapter protocol&quot; (DAP), designed to make it as simple as possible to add support for any given DAP-compliant adapter. Future adapters will soon be added (probably Go, Kotlin (for my own use), and Rust). - Tight integration with Claude. This made the project possible for me IMO, and hopefully will help contributors in the future. I&#x27;ve got a very nice skills system configured, based on my other project ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jefflester&#x2F;claude-skills-supercharged ), which has boosted Claude&#x27;s efficacy enormously in terms of implementation cleanliness and overall codebase knowledge. Additionally, the `dev-cli`, which is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the repo&#x27;s internal developer CLI, bootstraps many of Claude&#x27;s capabilities, like CI failure analysis, running tests, etc. - 100% open source and fast CI&#x2F;CD release times (CI run: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ai-debugger-inc&#x2F;aidb&#x2F;actions&#x2F;runs&#x2F;2065017... ). All components in my stack are open source (core Python deps, debug adapter deps, etc.). GitHub CI builds and publishes debug adapters, runs robust integration and unit tests, and ships everything in &lt; 15 mins, which is awesome, considering many of my tests actually test the full stack with misc. external language dependencies, like Node, Spring, Maven, Gradle, etc. My main goal is to make AI Debugger the go-to tool for agent-facing debugging. If this is interesting to you, let me know – I would love to get a few contributors up to speed, as this is a sizable codebase that needs to expand a bit still, and it will suck trying to maintain it solo indefinitely. Strength in numbers! Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for taking a look at my project. ----- *Relevant Links* - Repository: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ai-debugger-inc&#x2F;aidb - Documentation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-debugger.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F; - PyPi Package: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;ai-debugger-inc&#x2F;"

It&#x27;s not a configuration mess, I don&#x27;t need to manage dot files. You actually never have to touch config files. Things like aliases and functions can be saved from CLI. For the most part it works like bash. 2. Alt+H to open the manpage for command under the cursor, without messing with the command line. Best. Thing. Ever!!! 3. Extensive tab completions, which provide descriptions. Most of the time I don&#x27;t have to open manpages and just do &#x27;cmd -[TAB]&#x27;. History access is also much better. Alt+Up&#x2F;Down lets you inject tokenized history, like last command&#x27;s arguments. The only thing I frequently miss from bash is &#x27;&lt;&lt;&lt;&#x27; and &#x27;sudo !!&#x27;. The latter is a matter of habit, since fish provides Alt+S to toggle sudo prefixing. I do most scripting in bash, but only because it&#x27;s idiotic fun to mess with the arcane like that every once in a while. Did you know you can manage TCP I&#x2F;O in pure bash, via &#x2F;dev&#x2F;tcp&#x2F;$host&#x2F;$port?

There are some major legaltech&#x2F;legal AI companies but after speaking to dozens of law firms, none of them are finding these tools very valuable. But they have signed contracts with many seats, they are busy people, and tech is not intrinsic to them, so they are not in the business of just changing tools and building things in-house (a handful of them are). And the problem is despite massive amount of internal data, all the solutions fail on the relevance and precision scale. When I sit down with actual legal associates, I can see how immensely complex these workflows are, and to fully utilize this data moat you need: (1) multi-step agentic retrieval, (2) a set of rules&#x2F;heuristics to ground and steer everything per transaction&#x2F;case &quot;type&quot;, (3) adaptation&#x2F;fine-tuning towards the &quot;house language&#x2F;style&quot;, (4) integration towards many different data sources and tools; and you need to wrap all this with real-world evals (where LLM-as-a-judge technique often fail).",

If you&#x27;re not building something that solves real problems for people, you&#x27;re going to experience a time in your life you&#x27;ll regret it.

And I don’t mean “owns” from a legalist perspective, I mean “owns” as in the hacker meaning, like “owning” the box. Who has root? This is a very bizarre point compared to the author&#x27;s more cogent comment on the same topic yesterday: &gt; GPT$$$ is surely smart enough to separate you from whatever you have, be that with targeting advertising, a scam you fall for, or lobbying your government to take it from you. . Given that any AI product that is made can be parallelized and coordinated faster than any human organisation using productivity software that already exists, either the brainpower is sufficient that we get an Accelerando-esque displacement where all power relations favouring humans vanish or the AI tech hits some kind of brainpower ceiling that makes it incapable of competing with humans and we don&#x27;t even get viable robotic blue-collar replacements.

I will avoid political arguments and instead make a simple economic one, which is that in California there is a lot of money to be made by endlessly experimenting and trialing and suing for any given public proposal. And this incentivizes things like not teaching 10 year olds algebra, or taking 10 years to reintroduce algebra, when such a pedagogy is already well established for many decades, because you can make a career out of toying with outcomes. But we&#x27;re not talking about software simulations here: A whole generation of kids have been denied an educational opportunity that will have effects on the rest of their lives. This reintroduction is a decision that should have been made in a single day long ago if the well-being of the pupils was the goal of these schools.",

          "This is a little web app I developed a good while ago now to help people start learning ARMv7 assembly language and to understand how the computer hardware interprets and executes instructions of low level languages. The tutorial section should have enough content to get people started. Only a minimal understanding of comp sci concepts are required, so whether you&#x27;re completely new to programming or are experienced with high level languages and want to understand more about what goes on lower down, this tool is for you! I hope you enjoy it or learn something from it. I certainly enjoyed making it. Unfortunately, mobile is not supported since the simulator has a lot of moving parts which describe the state of the simulated computer hardware. I recommend a laptop or larger for the optimal experience :)."

          "Hi HN, I *built Spliff, a high-performance L7 sniffing and correlation engine in pure C23. The goal is to build a fully working, Linux-native EDR that isn&#x27;t a resource-hogging black box. The core innovation – &quot;Golden Thread&quot; correlation: Most eBPF sniffers capture SSL data OR packets. Spliff correlates both: XDP (NIC) → sock_ops (socket cookies) → Uprobes (SSL buffers) ↓ ↓ ↓ packets TCP 5-tuple decrypted data ↘ ↓ ↙ unified per-flow view This maps raw decrypted TLS data back to the exact TCP flow, PID, and process—something commercial EDRs struggle with. Technical highlights: • XDP + sock_ops + Uprobes – Three BPF program types working together via shared maps • Lock-free threading – Dispatcher&#x2F;Worker model with Concurrency Kit SPSC queues • Full HTTP&#x2F;2 – HPACK decompression, stream multiplexing, request-response correlation • No MITM – Hooks OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS, WolfSSL, BoringSSL directly via uprobes • Static binary fingerprinting – Build ID matching for stripped binaries (Chrome) • BPF-level filtering – AF_UNIX IPC filtered in kernel, not userspace Current status: Working L7 visibility engine. Captures and correlates HTTPS traffic in real-time. What&#x27;s next: Process behavior tracking, file&#x2F;network anomaly detection, event streaming (NATS&#x2F;Kafka), threat intel integration. Linux-only – Requires kernel 5.x+ with BTF, XDP, libbpf. --- The project is GPL-3.0 and we&#x27;re inviting anyone interested to contribute—whether it&#x27;s code, architecture feedback, security research, or ideas for EDR features that actually matter (not compliance theater). GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoFear0411&#x2F;spliff *Note: The codebase was written with Claude Opus. I provide the research, architecture decisions, and review every line.",
          "This is super cool, I always wanted a system to peak App packets before encryption gets applied.",
          "Just came here to say this is awesome to see more folks do novel stuff with XDP! After reading loophole labs post [0] a few months ago. I was hoping someone would cook on this for security research. [0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;loopholelabs.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;xdp-for-egress-traffic"

So I built DetLLM: it measures and proves repeatability using token-level traces + a first-divergence diff, and writes a minimal repro pack for every run (env snapshot, run config, applied controls, traces, report). I prototyped this version today in a few hours with Codex. The hardest part was the HLD I did a few days ago, but I was honestly surprised by how well Codex handled the implementation. I didn’t expect it to come together in under a day. Would love feedback, and if you find any prompts&#x2F;models&#x2F;setups that still make it diverge."

          "&gt; My eyes will thank you Sometimes I think the most hate for light mode is from people without autobrightness in their displays. Or from those who don’t know how to change it easily. Sure, if I were to constantly blind myself with 10k lux, I would hate white background too. But it isn’t supposed to be like that: make it the same brightness as the surroundings and voila. I’ve never met a person saying they hate books and wish they were white on black. Also with glossy display (like 6k xdr) the only way I can deal with reflections is by always using light mode. Alabaster code theme is my favorite. If you don’t have auto brightness, there are many apps to change it easily via UI or keyboard instead of manual knobs of your monitor — most of them for the past 10 years support control via hdmi&#x2F;displayport — I don’t see people complaining “I hate listening to most music because my headphones are always at 90% volume — every soundtrack should be lounge cafe del mar.” Or “I use this browser extension to make everything 5% loud.” Well, just turn down the volume knob, dummy.",
          "I’m not a big fan of dark mode and I seem to be in the minority these days. Probably 99% of my colleagues at work use dark mode and when I screen share I get the usual “ah, my eyes!” The interesting thing is, I’ve noticed when I read white on black and look elsewhere I see horizontal lines in my vision. So really I’m the one who should be shouting about their eyes. Maybe that’s just me, though? I guess I want my computing experience to be like that of reading a book. Not sure I’d like white text on black paper.",
          "I have stared at a light mode screen for 16 hours a day for 20 years without even the hint of discomfort. 5 minutes of dark mode and my eyes feel someone is shining lasers at me. I have concluded that light mode is for light mode people and dark mode is for dark mode people. Making light mode a little darker or dark mode a little lighter isn’t going to change how people experience interfaces. Make light mode for light people and dark mode for dark mode people. Maybe things are getting brighter, but it hasn’t been noticeable to me."

          "I am always wondering, if initiatives like these are a way to get a system in place that enables governments (by proxy of these platforms) a way to ensure any online activity is tied to a governmental id. Because if you want to use these platforms this would mean you would have to prove your age. Then I ask myself if I am wearing my tinfoil hat? Sadly, nowadays, I am just not sure anymore.",
          "IMO I think the better solution is to make a full feature smartphone an 18+ item, much like beer. If you are under 18 you only get a very limited &#x27;call mom&#x27; phone with no video camera, chat limited to your family, maps to find your way home with and an otherwise very restricted set of apps. Police can take contraband phones from teens much like they can take contraband beer. They would have a distinct design so the types are identifiable. No identity checking system needed for using the general internet as a result. You can still have a family ipad, TV, xbox, switch, laptop, school chromebook, large clunky semi-pro digital camera for movie club, a separate dedicated audio recorder, etc but the key is to stop gossip networks with video recordings &#x2F; snapchat and make the digital experience similar to what millenials grew up with, the last generation who didn&#x27;t get a huge spike in anxiety and depression. Yes many teens will still get around it, but the idea is to add a lot of friction so you stop the network effects that are causing this in the first place.",
          "If there were a store selling cigarettes to children, then naturally you&#x27;d want the store to stop doing it. It&#x27;s their responsibility. But they do need information about who they&#x27;re serving. (Just enough information.) Making a website adults-only should be as easy as setting a web server&#x27;s config parameter. The fact that the industry has taken so long to come up with a decent Internet standard for this is pretty ludicrous. It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect. Even just a minimal implementation like requiring an &quot;X-adult: yes&quot; HTTP header from the browser would work for a locked-down client like an iPhone. Sure, older kids will get around it but that&#x27;s okay; they probably learned something."

          "Hi all! I’ve been building chatgpt-cli for a while now (800+ stars), a command-line tool for working with LLMs. It supports things like prompt files, thread-based context, streaming, images and audio, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls. I just shipped a new experimental feature I’m really excited about: an agent mode that follows the ReAct loop (think → act → observe), similar to what tools like Claude Code and Cursor do. It can plan and execute multi-step tasks using shell commands, file operations, and LLM reasoning, all behind budget limits and safety policies (allowed tools, denied commands, workdir sandboxing). It’s still early, for example, you can’t yet resume workflows. I think it’s ready for people to try and break though! Quick silly test: chatgpt create a text file in this directory with a short weather report for where i am right now --agent Next, I want to iterate on the current version based on feedback before adding bigger ideas like parallel execution or sub-agents. If you try it, I’d love to hear what’s confusing, broken, or missing."

          "I built IWE (Interactive Writing Environment) to manage my markdown notes. It&#x27;s a CLI tool and LSP server written in Rust. The problem: I have thousands of markdown files with links between them. Link titles get out of sync when I rename files, I can&#x27;t easily find what links to what, and batch operations (normalize formatting, export graphs) required custom scripts. How it works: IWE loads markdown files into an in-memory graph structure that understands document hierarchy (headers, lists, links). This enables operations that would be hard to do with plain text processing. CLI: - iwe normalize - fix link titles, header levels, list numbering across all files - iwe stats - analyze your knowledge base (word counts, most connected docs, orphans) - iwe export dot - export link structure for Graphviz - iwe squash - combine linked docs into a single file (useful for generating PDFs) LSP (works with VS Code, Neovim, Helix, Zed): - Go-to-definition for links - Backlinks via find-references - Autocomplete for linking notes - Hover preview - Rename with automatic link updates - Code actions: extract section to new file, inline content back, convert lists↔headers Why another PKM tool? Obsidian is great but I wanted to stay in my editor (Neovim). Existing LSPs like markdown-oxide cover basics but I needed batch operations and more refactoring capabilities. Building both CLI and LSP on a shared Rust core made sense. Install: `brew tap iwe-org&#x2F;iwe &amp;&amp; brew install iwe` or `cargo install iwe iwes` Happy to answer questions about the architecture or implementation."

          "Something remarkable happened in 2024-2025: building a full-stack app became easy. Tools like Supabase, combined with AI coding assistants and no-code builders, let solo founders ship production apps in days, not months. But speed comes at a cost. As we started using SupaExplorer to audit projects, we noticed a pattern: many apps were misconfiguring their Supabase setup. The anon key in client-side code is fine; it&#x27;s designed to be public. But we found apps exposing the service_role key (which bypasses RLS), or using the anon key with tables that had no RLS policies at all. We decided to quantify the problem. Over the past month, we collected launch URLs from five major indie product directories and systematically scanned each one. - 20,052 URLs Scanned - 2,217 Domains Exposed - 11.04% Exposure Rate - 2,325 Critical Exposures What&#x27;s Being Leaked Not all exposures are equal. Finding a Supabase project URL and anon key in client code is expected, as both are designed to be public. The anon key provides low-privilege access that respects your Row Level Security policies. The danger is when apps expose the service_role key (or the new sb_secret_... format), the elevated-privilege key meant only for server-side use. Of the 2,960 files flagged, we found credentials that could bypass RLS in a significant portion. We also verified which exposed databases had tables without RLS protection. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, and how can we generating awareness about this topic.",

          "Mozart wrote for audiences who were only half paying attention. If that is all he had done -- and it was all that most of his peers did -- he would be forgotten. But at the same time he also wrote for audiences who were paying the closest possible attention. He is remembered for doing both . It is quite a trick, as you will see if you try it. Netflix do not even see the need for it, and therefore, their &quot;works&quot; will be forgotten.",
          "Some TV is already like this. I recall critics of Teletubbies complaining about the repeated statements and actions (Tinky-Winky says &quot;Again! Again!&quot;). Then I spent time in Asia and all their popular entertainment (eg Running Man) continually repeats the last 10 seconds of each action. It&#x27;s crazy making to me, but it evidently is what the viewers like.",
          "&quot;Can we get a big one in the first five minutes?&quot; That&#x27;s in screenwriter circles called the hook, not the plot. You don&#x27;t reiterate the whole plot for the innate viewers, you just deepen the hook, usually by giving wrong hooks, which are then replaced by better hooks. It&#x27;s not that Netflix invented TV scripting. Even with festival movies you turn it off within the first 5 minutes if you have to judge 200 to 2000 admissions in a month. Same with distributors. They certainly don&#x27;t watch the whole movie if it starts bad. It usually doesn&#x27;t get better in the third act."

The primary file alone was 18k+ lines of Typescript that was a terrible mess of spaghetti. Most of it had been written in JavaScript but later converted haphazardly. I ended up writing myself a little app that used the Typescript compiler APIs to help me just explore all the many branches of the code and annotate how I would refactor different parts. It helped a bit, but I never got time to add some of the more intelligent features I wanted like finding every execution path between two points.",

You need about 300 GB of RAM to keep your keys in RAM, which is also doable on a single machine. Next to that you may some random disk access (40k random IOPS per NVMe). You can put a few of those in the box as well. Throw in some extra RAM to keep hot disk blocks memory mapped and reduce IOPS. I think you can rent such a machine for about 1000 EUR a month including 250TB of traffic, which may not be enough if you have 24/7 this load, but you probably have not."

          "&gt; In July 2024, the Internet Watch Foundation\n\nThe Internet Watch Foundation cannot be trusted to tell the truth about anything. They are currently spearheading the Chat Control lobbying push in the EU. The IWF wants AI powered mass surveillance watching everything you do online, along with mandatory encryption backdoors and other authoritarian ideas.\n\n\n&gt; And the worst may be yet to come: Meta and other companies have proposed that future AI models be open source. “Open source” means anyone can access the code behind it, download it and edit it as they please. What is usually wonderful about open-source software – the freedom it gives users to create new things, prioritizing creativity and collaboration over profit – could be a disaster for children’s safety.\n\n&gt; Once someone downloaded an open-source AI platform and made it their own, there would be no safeguards, no AI bot saying that it couldn’t help with their request. Anyone could “fine-tune” their own personal image generator using explicit or illegal images, and make their own infinite CSAM and “revenge porn” generator.\n\n&gt; Meta seems to have stepped back from making its newer AI platforms open source. Perhaps Mark Zuckerberg remembered that he wants to be like the Roman emperor Augustus, and that if he continued down this path, he might be remembered more as the Oppenheimer of CSAM.\n\nThe author of this article is demanding a ban on open source AI, and is literally praising Meta for keeping AI tech in the hands of large corporations only. That sounds a lot like a slight remix of the Effective Altruist idea that only large corporations can be trusted with AI technology.\n\nMara Wilson is at best an idiot, and at worse, a fascist/authoritarian sympathizer.",

And so the admin, rather than focusing on a solution that we all know will work, is choosing instead to invest in high-tech stopgaps that may or may not work.\n\nEdit: corrected misspelling.",

          "They’re not autonomous robots, they’re remotely controlled by… wait for it… an OB/GYN. They’re trying to use a force multiplier instead of, you know, prioritizing women’s health care so that there is an incentive for people to become OB/GYNs and serve in rural areas, as well as more densely in cities so people can get better health; especially as this administration allegedly is worried about the declining birth rate, you’d think any measure that helps women have healthy babies would be a priority."

We spend so much time on configuring... The error messages are pretty much nonexistent. We have a list what things like \"ninja not found\" *actually* means. And then the absolute bonkers behaviour like silently ignoring reading of undefined variables. Imagine making a typo in your cml and it gets silently unnoticed. Top design choice really\n\nI miss vcxprojs. It was at least two orders of magnitude faster. And you could actually use compiler features when they ship and don't have to wait several years longer until this random GitHub project decides to make a flag non experimental. Heck even writing cl.exe calls in a batch file is more reasonable than cmake\n\nCmake is the single biggest problem of c++ by an incredible margin.",

They can’t jam starlink forever, it’s too expensive. Either that or ban all cell phones which isn’t happening either.\n\nI remember living in Iran for a summer in 2008.

And the way these two bubbles were “financed” is different. In case of dot com, money were coming from “outside”… in case of AI bubble, it starting to look more and more like some kind of “circular pyramid scheme”. Companies investing in each other to make it look like this is where “next big thing” is and to inflate valuations to laughable numbers. \n\nAnd all this happening in much worse economical and political environment.

Their work is already out of date by the time they are done their project and they are under a lot of pressure to just move on to the next thing. A lot of researchers will just abandon the code as soon as they are done with it and the incentive to actually produce reproducible stuff that works is nil. There's no reward for it, and you're slowing yourself down if you try to produce it. \n\n\nWhile we should all strive for a thriving research community with well document reproducible code, you probably just shouldn't rely on other researchers for your work.",

          "Hey, I am currently at one of the frontier companies in the LLM-field. Right now it's a really chaotic time. In general, the hiring of new grads/interns is down to about 20% of previous years. The reasoning from senior leadership are LLM models, we are encouraged to use LLMs for all tasks, and a senior with a couple of agent can iterate on ideas much faster and more accurate/meaningfully than any new hire. Every 6 months (down to 3-4 at some other frontier companies I have contacts on), you have an evaluation and might end up with a warning if you did not produce enough. Second warning is the last warning, you are out.\n\nThis means that the newly hired people are expected to be experts, and in general are expected to perform what before would have been a total outlier as an intern 5 years ago. You are supposed to be both a domain area expert, systems expert and programming expert.\n\nI would recommend that you either:\n\n1. Learn to code really well by yourself, learn AI agents really well, and identify where they can help you and where they are wrong.\n2. Apply to academic positions. \n3. Apply to less prestigious jobs. Small companies have R&amp;D depts as well that are not as streamlined.",

          "What about the cost of this \"successful experiment\"? This is what the Cursor blog post says: \"over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens\", 1 million tokens of Chatgpt 5.2 are 14 dollars, let's say they wasted 5 trillion tokens running this: 14 * 5,000,000 = 70,000,000 million dollars. 70m dollars for something that doesn't work… The Ladybird browser project(which browser actually works) has 8 full time employees: 120.000 * 8 = 960.000 dollars. So Cursor could have paid almost 73 years of development for the Ladybird project! All these numbers sound crazy, but you have to remember that all the AI services are heavily subsidized, so you have to 2x or maybe 3x the cost of this \"browser\" built \"fully autonomously\" to see the real cost. So 140~210 million dollars for a repo that doesn't build?",

Where is the MLX-API-call that makes batching happen that otherwise is not happening in other frameworks?",

          "Coevolution leading to a kind of locally optimal tuple of model formulation, solver structure, and backing hardware is a trend that I agree exists in ML. And you can see it in other domains using HPC in the broader technical computing world. I guess it's just that the incentives for incremental development are better than those for trying to break out and focus on something very different, in almost every field.",
          "Full essay: [https://open.substack.com/pub/lambpetros/p/the-transformer-attractor](https://open.substack.com/pub/lambpetros/p/the-transformer-attractor)\n\nThe RetNet case is particularly interesting because we genuinely can't tell from public evidence whether it failed due to hidden hardware friction at scale, quality degradation beyond 6.7B, or pure risk aversion. Microsoft never published the experiments that would distinguish these.",
          "I think it’s fine that phd candidates work on experimental architectures that aren’t used in large scaled projects yet. The big companies will catch on once that research is more developed. It seems the RetNet author still is interested in model architecture, so it’s not like he gave up on it.\n\nAlso, didn’t some large Chinese model use some idea inspired by this work?"

        "comments": [
          "I have limited experiences with flows (mostly teaching the concepts, no \"serious\" applications beyond generating something like 64x64 CelebA), but I personally found that yes, that can be an issue leading to underfitting. It also interacts weirdly with the function you use to compute the scale. That is, you usually apply something like exp() to the scale outputs to force them into positive numbers. However, many implementations quietly replace this by something else. For example the official Glow implementation from OpenAI actually has the exp commented out and uses sigmoid instead, contradicting the paper. How much impact the weight decay has in practice will differ a lot depending on the function used.\n\nI found it especially troublesome in models where you have neural network plus \"other\" parameters, e.g. in Glow the 1x1 convolutions and the \"activation normalization\" parameters are somewhat separated from the neural network weights. Does it make sense to put weight decay on those parameters? If so, do they need a different scale?\n\nOn the other hand, no weight decay can lead to degenerate solutions where the scale keeps increasing to \"blow up\" the Jacobian determinant, until you run into numerical issues and the whole thing explodes (especially with exp scaling). It seems like in practice you need some kind of restraint on the model to prevent this.\n\nDepending on what you are doing, maybe it's worth looking into more recent architectures like Flow Matching; they don't seem to have such issues and are also invertible (up to ODE discretization error).",
          "I think your intuition is basically right. In RealNVP style flows, small weights are not neutral in the way they are for a plain discriminative model. They explicitly mean closer to identity, so L2 is not just shrinking capacity, it is pushing the model toward a very specific solution that already has high likelihood early on. That makes the optimization dynamics a bit weird, especially combined with zero init on the scale nets.\n\nIn practice I have seen people rely more on architectural constraints, early stopping, or data dependent init rather than weight decay for exactly this reason. If you want regularization, penalizing extreme log scale outputs or using spectral constraints feels more aligned with what actually causes pathologies in flows. The fact that many codebases keep weight decay by default feels more like habit than a principled choice.",

          "It exists, but the definition usually collapses once you look closely. In most real systems, video sentiment ends up being a fusion of ASR plus text sentiment, with some lightweight prosody or facial features layered on. The hard part is not classifying affect, it is grounding sentiment in what is being referred to and over what temporal window. For long-form video, context drift and speaker intent dominate, and current models struggle to stay coherent without heavy supervision or task-specific structure. In practice, teams either narrow the scope to short clips with clear labels or accept noisy signals that are only useful in aggregate. The question is less whether it is possible and more whether the signal is reliable enough to drive decisions that actually ship.",

          "I want to be completely honest. I personally would say a profile like this is a huge red flag. Research is NOT about publishing a lot of papers it's about working on true open ended problems. There are several \"red flags\" in this person's publication history. Firstly some of his work is 800+ pages. Like what? That is obviously just a bunch of slop. His advisor seems to be a \"low impact\" Mill just writing a bunch of low quality, non impactful work. \n\nAlso most of his work are preprints / workshop papers. Not saying there's anything wrong with preprints but I can guarantee you that the quality of much of this work seems to be on the lower side. And the novelty seems to be low.\n\nTo give you some true insights. Most undergrad students at top unis (Ivy/Ivy+) might not publish a single first author paper and if they do it's typically not something which is going to be impactful. You should be less worried about publishing and more concerned about learning. Joining a lab and working on a project is a great way to get experience. \n\nQuality &gt; quantity",
          "Keep in mind those ICLR things are workshops and not Main (workshops can have 50%ish acceptance rates though they're still good to have). I think in general the cost of scientific research has decreased dramatically with LLMs so it's possible.\n\nFor what it's worth this publication rate is pretty normal for some of the more competitive labs and the person 'advising' him seems to be independent and might be very focused on the mentor relationship",
          "Definitely possible for a smart student who is being coached closely by a senior collaborator. \nHaving a good, close collaborator is an absolute cheat code to get you through all stages of a research project. \n\nDoesn't mean they're good papers \n\nHe definitely should not be reviewing though, that's crazy"

        "comments": [
          "I have not interviewed there specifically, but for roles like that the vagueness is usually intentional. They are less interested in whether you can implement a transformer from scratch and more in how you reason when something is messy or partially broken. In practice, the ML coding rounds tend to focus on reading unfamiliar code, spotting conceptual bugs, and making reasonable tradeoffs under time pressure. Things like data leakage, incorrect evaluation, shape issues, bad batching, or misunderstanding what the model is actually optimizing show up a lot. I would spend more time practicing debugging small PyTorch pipelines and explaining why you would change something than memorizing LLM hyperparameters. If you can clearly articulate how data, training, and evaluation interact, that usually matters more than reimplementing algorithms.",
          "From what I have seen, those interviews usually test applied judgment more than textbook completeness. The ML part is often vague on purpose, because they want to see how you reason about a messy system rather than whether you can rederive an algorithm. I would focus on being fluent at reading unfamiliar PyTorch code, spotting silent bugs, and explaining trade-offs in model or data choices.\n\nImplementing full NLP or CV algorithms from scratch is unlikely. It is more common to be asked to modify or debug an existing training loop, reason about why a model is not converging, or suggest concrete fixes based on observed behavior. Being able to talk clearly about data issues, logging, evaluation leakage, and scaling bottlenecks tends to matter more than knowing every hyperparameter by name.\n\nThe strongest signal usually comes from how you explain your thinking out loud. If you can connect symptoms to likely failure modes and propose pragmatic next steps, that tends to land well in research engineer interviews.",
          "For the ML coding part, they'll probably ask you to debug a transformer implementation with subtle bugs - like incorrect attention masking or positional encoding issues. I've seen this pattern at a few companies recently.\n\nYou won't need to implement full NLP algorithms from scratch but expect questions on modifying existing architectures. Think stuff like adding a custom loss function or tweaking attention mechanisms for specific use cases.\n\nThe data parsing round is usually straightforward - JSON/CSV manipulation, handling edge cases in messy datasets. Maybe some pandas optimization if they're feeling fancy.\n\nOther thing that helped others prep for similar interviews was doing mocks with ML engineers from these companies. i work at Prepfully and we have some Scale AI folks who coach - they give pretty specific insights on what the interviewers focus on. Worth spending a bit wrt to ROI\n\nDon't overthink the LLM hyperparameters part... they care more about your debugging intuition than memorizing exact learning rates or batch sizes"

          "Funny enough I have masters in both statistics/ML and cognitive science. I wasn't exposed much to statistical/machine learning in cog sci because the emphasis was on inference (the 'target' was interpretable and unbiased model parameters), but I can think of a few topics/examples:\n\n* The other poster mentioned computational cognitive science, I'd look specifically at cognitive architectures within that. These are basically computational representations of cognitive functions, and have involved both theory and instantiation. \n* I did some work in the cog sci domain after studying stats/ML and saw a bit of tension when textbook use cases for ML came up for one reason or another. In one instance, a \"biomathematical\" model was being used to predict fatigue levels based on people's sleep patterns, and in another the task was to predict teacher attrition statewide at different levels of aggregation. The former is an example of institutional momentum resulting in a suboptimal solutions - the biomathematical model was based on the research of the same person selling the software making the predictions and heading the government org mandating its use. I built an algorithm clearly working better, but we weren't allowed to use it in any official capacity. The latter was a case of researchers reinventing the wheel because they didn't know any better. They spent 6 years building this horrid series of Excel workbooks to function as a pipeline for a rudimentary forecasting approach. You'd spend a week copying, pasting, and dragging things just to format a time series and use =TREND() for every single school in the state (and even more time on the parts that spit out/validated the predictions). The researchers involved had no exposure to time series forecasting or programming, so they really had no idea that you could write a script doing the same thing in a day, and didn't know how to use more principled forecasting approaches. \n* Like I said earlier the emphasis is usually on statistical inference, but some subfields are tackling problems where ML is a natural fit. My first masters focused on Human Factors, which is all about task performance and safety. I was in the program just before data science really started booming, and I'd be shocked if ML isn't playing a much larger role there. Most of the projects I worked involved prediction and monitoring of people interacting with complex systems (operating vehicles, using a computer, control rooms at power plants, etc). \n* Psychometrics can drift into machine learning territory in different ways. Factor Analysis was originally developed/introduced for this purpose, and new approaches extend the core concept with neural networks. \n\nHopefully that at least gives you a direction to look in. I studied statistical learning in a theoretical capacity long after studying cog sci, so unfortunately I can't say a whole lot about how it's used in that field specifically - aside from things I've dealt with here and there.",
          "In ML, statistical learning is usually a formal framework for generalization from finite samples, so things like inductive bias, capacity, and how error scales with data. It is less about a specific mechanism and more about guarantees or failure modes under assumptions. In cognitive science, the term often points to a hypothesized process humans use to extract regularities from sensory input, with an emphasis on plausibility and experimental prediction.\n\nThere is overlap in the math, but the goals differ. ML asks when and why a system trained on data will work on new data. Cognitive science asks whether a particular learning rule explains observed behavior. That difference in objective tends to drive how the same concepts get framed and tested."

What stood out to me was how many of the issues you hit were about stability and ops details, not the high level architecture. That mirrors a lot of product work where the last 20 percent is just managing weird edge cases. Curious how you think about the usefulness of this beyond the learning itself, like would you ever try to deploy or distill something like this, or is the goal mainly understanding the system end to end. Either way, props for writing it up so clearly.",
          "What material(s) did you use to learn all of this?",
          "This is honestly impressive, especially given the constraints you are working under. What stands out to me is that you are tracking the right failure modes rather than just celebrating throughput or loss curves. Small MoEs are brutal because a lot of the tricks from large-scale settings break silently, so the instability you describe around routing and scaling is very familiar. The dense first layer and symmetric init point is a lesson many people only learn after weeks of confusion. The interesting question to me is whether this setup actually teaches you transferable intuition for larger systems, or whether the single-GPU constraints force you into regimes that would not survive scale. Either way, the fact that you can articulate these trade-offs already puts you ahead of most people experimenting casually."
