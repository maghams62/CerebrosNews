But also on the list is sodium-ion batteries, \"a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium.\" Backed by major players and public investment, they're poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide. [Chinese battery giant CATL claims to have already started manufacturing sodium-ion batteries at scale, and BYD also plans a massive production facility for sodium-ion batteries.] The most significant impact of sodium-Âion technology may be not on our roads but on our power grids.

In 2025, the most consequential works weren't about a single breakthrough model. Instead, they challenged fundamental assumptions that academicians and corporations have quietly relied on: Bigger models mean better reasoning, RL creates new capabilities, attention is “solved” and generative models inevitably memorize. This year’s top papers collectively point to a deeper shift: AI progress is now constrained less by raw model capacity and more by architecture, training dynamics and evaluation strategy. Below is a technical deep dive into five of the most influential NeurIPS 2025 papers — and what they mean for anyone building real-world AI systems. 1. LLMs are converging—and we finally have a way to measure it Paper: Artificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of Language Models For years, LLM evaluation has focused on correctness. But in open-ended or ambiguous tasks like brainstorming, ideation or creative synthesis, there often is no single correct answer. The risk instead is homogeneity: Models producing the same “safe,” high-probability responses. This paper introduces Infinity-Chat, a benchmark designed explicitly to measure diversity and pluralism in open-ended generation. Rather than scoring answers as right or wrong, it measures: Intra-model collapse: How often the same model repeats itself Inter-model homogeneity: How similar different models’ outputs are The result is uncomfortable but important: Across architectures and providers, models increasingly converge on similar outputs — even when multiple valid answers exist. Why this matters in practice For corporations, this reframes “alignment” as a trade-off. Preference tuning and safety constraints can quietly reduce diversity, leading to assistants that feel too safe, predictable or biased toward dominant viewpoints. Takeaway: If your product relies on creative or exploratory outputs, diversity metrics need to be first-class citizens. 2. Attention isn’t finished — a simple gate changes everything Paper: Gated Attention for Large Language Models Transformer attention has been treated as settled engineering. This paper proves it isn’t. The authors introduce a small architectural change: Apply a query-dependent sigmoid gate after scaled dot-product attention, per attention head. That’s it. No exotic kernels, no massive overhead. Across dozens of large-scale training runs — including dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models trained on trillions of tokens — this gated variant: Improved stability Reduced “attention sinks” Enhanced long-context performance Consistently outperformed vanilla attention Why it works The gate introduces: Non-linearity in attention outputs Implicit sparsity, suppressing pathological activations This challenges the assumption that attention failures are purely data or optimization problems. Takeaway: Some of the biggest LLM reliability issues may be architectural — not algorithmic — and solvable with surprisingly small changes. 3. RL can scale — if you scale in depth, not just data Paper: 1,000-Layer Networks for Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning Conventional wisdom says RL doesn’t scale well without dense rewards or demonstrations. This paper reveals that that assumption is incomplete. By scaling network depth aggressively from typical 2 to 5 layers to nearly 1,000 layers, the authors demonstrate dramatic gains in self-supervised, goal-conditioned RL, with performance improvements ranging from 2X to 50X. The key isn’t brute force. It’s pairing depth with contrastive objectives, stable optimization regimes and goal-conditioned representations Why this matters beyond robotics For agentic systems and autonomous workflows, this suggests that representation depth — not just data or reward shaping — may be a critical lever for generalization and exploration. Takeaway: RL’s scaling limits may be architectural, not fundamental. 4. Why diffusion models generalize instead of memorizing Paper: Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training Diffusion models are massively overparameterized, yet they often generalize remarkably well. This paper explains why. The authors identify two distinct training timescales: One where generative quality rapidly improves Another — much slower — where memorization emerges Crucially, the memorization timescale grows linearly with dataset size, creating a widening window where models improve without overfitting. Practical implications This reframes early stopping and dataset scaling strategies. Memorization isn’t inevitable — it’s predictable and delayed. Takeaway: For diffusion training, dataset size doesn’t just improve quality — it actively delays overfitting. 5. RL improves reasoning performance, not reasoning capacity Paper: Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning in LLMs? Perhaps the most strategically important result of NeurIPS 2025 is also the most sobering. This paper rigorously tests whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) actually creates new reasoning abilities in LLMs — or simply reshapes existing ones. Their conclusion: RLVR primarily improves sampling efficiency, not reasoning capacity. At large sample sizes, the base model often already contains the correct reasoning trajectories. What this means for LLM training pipelines RL is better understood as: A distribution-shaping mechanism Not a generator of fundamentally new capabilities Takeaway: To truly expand reasoning capacity, RL likely needs to be paired with mechanisms like teacher distillation or architectural changes — not used in isolation. The bigger picture: AI progress is becoming systems-limited Taken together, these papers point to a common theme: The bottleneck in modern AI is no longer raw model size — it’s system design. Diversity collapse requires new evaluation metrics Attention failures require architectural fixes RL scaling depends on depth and representation Memorization depends on training dynamics, not parameter count Reasoning gains depend on how distributions are shaped, not just optimized For builders, the message is clear: Competitive advantage is shifting from “who has the biggest model” to “who understands the system.” Maitreyi Chatterjee is a software engineer.

While building it, I made a few architectural decisions that go against the \"standard\" Rust web/systems path. I wanted to share the rationale and the performance implications of those choices. 1. Why I ditched Async/Await for a Custom Runtime The standard advice in Rust is \"just use Tokio.\" However, generic async runtimes are designed primarily for IO-bound tasks with many idle connections. In a database execution pipeline, tasks are often CPU-heavy (scanning/filtering compressed pages). I found that mixing heavy compute with standard async executors led to unpredictable scheduling latency. Instead, I implemented a Morsel-Driven Parallelism model (inspired by DuckDB/Hyper): Queries are broken into \"morsels\" (fixed-size row groups). Instead of a central scheduler, worker threads use lock-free work stealing. A query job holds an AtomicUsize counter. Threads race to increment it (CAS), effectively \"claiming\" the next step of the pipeline. This keeps CPU cores pinned and maximizes instruction cache locality, as threads tend to stick to specific logic loops (Scanning vs Filtering). 2. Batched io_uring vs. Standard Syscalls For the WAL (Write-Ahead Log), fsync latency is the killer. I built a custom storage engine (\"Walrus\") to leverage Linux's io_uring. Instead of issuing pwrite syscalls one by one, the writer constructs a submission queue of ~2,000 entries in userspace. It issues a single submit_and_wait syscall to flush them all. This reduced the context-switching overhead significantly, allowing the engine to saturate NVMe bandwidth on a single thread. 3. The \"Spin-Lock\" Allocator This was the riskiest decision. Standard OS mutexes (pthread_mutex) put threads to sleep, costing microseconds. For the disk block allocator, I implemented a custom AtomicBool spin-lock. It spins in a tight loop (std::hint::spin_loop()) for nanoseconds. Trade-off: If the OS preempts the thread holding the lock, the system stalls. But because the critical section is just simple integer math (calculating offsets), it executes faster than the OS scheduler quantum, making this statistically safe and extremely fast. 4. Zero-Copy Serialization I used rkyv instead of serde. Serde is great, but it usually involves deserialization steps (parsing bytes into structs). rkyv guarantees that the in-memory representation is identical to the on-disk representation, allowing for true zero-copy access by just casting pointers on the raw buffer. I'm curious if others here have hit similar walls with Tokio in CPU-bound contexts, or if I just failed to tune it correctly? submitted by /u/Ok_Marionberry8922 [link] [comments]","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qfkijn/engineering_a_columnar_database_in_rust_lessons","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T18:16:44.000Z","sourceName":"Reddit r/programming","sourceType":"community","text":"I recently released the core engine for Frigatebird, an OLAP (Columnar) database built from scratch.

In a database execution pipeline, tasks are often CPU-heavy (scanning/filtering compressed pages). I found that mixing heavy compute with standard async executors led to unpredictable scheduling latency. Instead, I implemented a Morsel-Driven Parallelism model (inspired by DuckDB/Hyper): Queries are broken into \"morsels\" (fixed-size row groups). Instead of a central scheduler, worker threads use lock-free work stealing. A query job holds an AtomicUsize counter. Threads race to increment it (CAS), effectively \"claiming\" the next step of the pipeline. This keeps CPU cores pinned and maximizes instruction cache locality, as threads tend to stick to specific logic loops (Scanning vs Filtering). 2. Batched io_uring vs. Standard Syscalls For the WAL (Write-Ahead Log), fsync latency is the killer. I built a custom storage engine (\"Walrus\") to leverage Linux's io_uring. Instead of issuing pwrite syscalls one by one, the writer constructs a submission queue of ~2,000 entries in userspace. It issues a single submit_and_wait syscall to flush them all. This reduced the context-switching overhead significantly, allowing the engine to saturate NVMe bandwidth on a single thread. 3. The \"Spin-Lock\" Allocator This was the riskiest decision. Standard OS mutexes (pthread_mutex) put threads to sleep, costing microseconds. For the disk block allocator, I implemented a custom AtomicBool spin-lock. It spins in a tight loop (std::hint::spin_loop()) for nanoseconds. Trade-off: If the OS preempts the thread holding the lock, the system stalls. But because the critical section is just simple integer math (calculating offsets), it executes faster than the OS scheduler quantum, making this statistically safe and extremely fast. 4. Zero-Copy Serialization I used rkyv instead of serde. Serde is great, but it usually involves deserialization steps (parsing bytes into structs). rkyv guarantees that the in-memory representation is identical to the on-disk representation, allowing for true zero-copy access by just casting pointers on the raw buffer. I'm curious if others here have hit similar walls with Tokio in CPU-bound contexts, or if I just failed to tune it correctly? submitted by /u/Ok_Marionberry8922 [link] [comments]","tags":[]},{"id":"598ccea34f6fa8bee1b172fb","title":"It's the last day to get up to $90 off reMarkable E Ink tablet bundles","summary":"E Ink tablet maker reMarkable is running a bundle deal right now that can save you between $80 and $90 when buying a reMarkable 2 along with a Marker stylus and a folio case. The savings vary depending on the bundle you configure, but this can bring your out-the-door cost down to $449 from $529 for the tablet, Marker stylus and polymer weave book folio. The offer runs through January 17. The company also sells a newer stylus called Marker Plus that lets you erase by flipping it around just like a real pencil, but that will cost you an extra $50. If you’ve been eyeing a dedicated writing tablet for work, school or just jotting down notes without the distraction of endless apps, this bundle deal is an ideal opportunity to pick one up. The reMarkable 2 earned our top pick for best e-ink tablet. In our review, we said the tablet was prettier than ever with a 10.3-inch display and a handsome aluminum frame. The tablet is only 4.7mm thick and weighs less than a pound, helping it feel lean and portable. The display can detect over 4,000 different levels of pressure with the Marker stylus, allowing for precise shading when sketching and the latency between the stylus and the screen is just 21ms. reMarkable fitted the display with a resin layer on top of the glass to make writing on it feel more realistic. We didn't think this passed muster, but we found writing on it was a joy nonetheless. The tablet supports PDFs and ePUBs, which can be added via the companion mobile app or a desktop computer. You can also pair the reMarkable 2 with Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to access files. The battery is rated for an impressive two weeks between charges. The reMarkable Paper Pro, a higher-end model with a richer feature set like a full color display and a built-in reading light, is our pick for best premium e-ink tablet.

The League Pass Premium subscription is on sale for $75, down from $160, while League Pass Standard is marked down to $50 from $110. We're almost halfway through the season at this point, so it makes sense for a service like League Pass to start offering some discounts. The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once. Last year, League Pass added multiview, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game. Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.

The Bluetooth trackers are priced pretty reasonably even when not on sale, but they can be a steal if you can get them on a discount — like right now. A four pack of AirTags is on sale for $65 at Amazon, which is only a few dollars more than the record-low price we saw during Black Friday this year. AirTags can be useful for people who travel frequently, helping you to keep track of essentials like your passport as well as a way to keep tabs on luggage while you're on the go. If you do purchase some AirTags, we have some recommendations for useful accessories to go along with them, such as different styles of cases to best attach the trackers to different types of items. These are worth looking over and adding to your shopping cart in order to make the most of the product. AirTags have an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance and their replaceable batteries should last for about a year. They can also support Precision Finding, which gives more exact directions to a lost item, when paired with most models after the iPhone 11. Up to five people can share an AirTag's location, which is helpful for families or large travel groups. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.

Speedy performance. | Image: The Verge Happy Saturday, folks! This week, Best Buy kicked off its so-called “Winter Sale,” introducing a whole host of price cuts that range from not-so-good to legitimately great, at least for this time of year. We’ll be publishing many of the highlights in a dedicated news post tomorrow, though, per usual, not all of this week’s best deals revolve around Best Buy. Apple’s M4 Mac Mini, for instance, is receiving a $100 discount at Amazon and B&H Photo, while LG’s 65-inch C5 OLED TV is on sale at eBay for a little over a grand. There are also steep savings to be had on 45W power banks, the Beats Fit Pro, and more, so let’s dive in. Mac Mini with M4 Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (256GB) $599 $499 at B&H Photo (256GB) $799 $689 at Amazon (512GB) If you want a Mac and your budget is less than $500, your only real option — aside from going the refurbished route or picking up a model that’s several generations old — is Apple’s latest Mac Mini. Thankfully, the desktop machine makes for a truly excellent daily driver, one that’s currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $499 ($100), which is just $20 shy of its Black Friday low and about $30 less than its best price to date. For most people, the 2024 Mac Mini is a far better (and more economical) choice than the latest Mac Studio. The tiny, M4-powered machine is an excellent value, even at full price, with three Thunderbolt 4 (USB 4) ports, a gigabit ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio input, and an HDMI port. Its 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU provide fast, consistent performance for a wide range of tasks; however, keep in mind that you’ll need to bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse. Read our full Mac Mini (2024) review. Iniu Carry P51L-E2 Power Bank 45W 20000mAh Where to Buy: $36.99 $18.86 at Amazon (at checkout) Last year, we saw a spate of power bank recalls, including those from both Anker and ESR. I replaced one of my aging Anker models during that time with Iniu’s excellent Carry P51L-E2, which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $18.86 (about $21 off) at checkout. The 20,000mAh power bank isn’t particularly fancy, though it does output up to 45W of power and features a built-in, braided USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard. You also get an extra USB-C and USB-A port, allowing you to juice your phone, tablet, a pair of wireless earbuds, and other small electronics at the same time. Now, if only Iniu could have packed the extra battery capacity into a charger as compact and colorful as the like-minded Pocket Rocket P50. C’est la vie. LG C5 OLED TV (65-inch) Where to Buy: $2699.99 $1197.59 at eBay (with code FAVEFINDS20) Arguably the best TV deal you can find this weekend would be on the 65-inch Bravia 8 II, which is still hovering around $2,398 (over $1,000 off) at multiple retailers, including Amazon. But not everyone has that kind of money to throw around on an OLED panel, which makes the current discount on LG’s C5 more appealing. Now through January 20th, you can pick up LG’s 65-inch OLED TV at eBay for $1,197.59 ($1,502 off) when you use code FAVEFINDS20 at checkout. Like prior models in the C Series, the C5 is all about value. The 4K set delivers the deep black levels and contrast for which OLEDs are known, and it features LG’s AI Picture Pro, which analyzes what you’re watching and adjusts brightness, resolution, and other settings to improve clarity. It also features a bevy of gaming-friendly features, including a 120Hz refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing you to play current-gen titles in 4K at up to 120fps. It’s rounded out with HDR10 and Dolby Vision support, further enhancing color and contrast. Beats Fit Pro Where to Buy: $199.95 $89.99 at Woot Having now used both the Beats Fit Pro and the new Powerbeats Fit as part of my weekly workout regimen, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there’s little difference between the two — well, other than the fact that the Powerbeats Fit retail for $199.95 and the last-gen Beats Fit Pro are on sale at Woot in select colors for $89.99 ($110 off) through January 31st. Beats’ latest workout earbuds also feature a smaller charging case and more flexible wing tips, I guess, but with the Fit Pro, you’re still getting solid noise cancellation, good sound, and all the Apple ecosystem tricks you’d expect for less than half the price. Read our full Beats Fit Pro review. More ways to save this weekend Elgato’s Stream Deck Plus is matching its all-time low at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, where you can pick it up for $159.99 ($40 off) for a limited time. Like the standard Stream Deck, the Plus model comes with a slew of large, programmable LCD keys — eight, in this case — which you can use to automate a variety of tasks on your computer or control various smart home devices. The Plus comes with a few neat add-ons, though, specifically four knobs for making finer adjustments and a narrow touchscreen at the bottom for viewing tidbits of information at a glance. Read our review. If you’re a modern gamer with a soft spot for the Sega Genesis, 8BitDo’s M30 Bluetooth Controller is down to an all-time low of $20.98 ($4 off) at Amazon as part of an ongoing lightning deal. The inexpensive, retro-styled gamepad sports a similar layout to Sega’s iconic controller, only it comes with Bluetooth, 20 hours of battery life, and built-in buttons for quick access to the homescreen and snapping screenshots. It also works with a handful of platforms, including the Nintendo Switch, Windows, Mac, and Android. Speaking of gaming, Steam’s weeklong Detective Fest is set to wind down at 1PM ET on Monday, January 19th. That means that this weekend is one of your last chances to pick up a copy of The Case of the Golden Idol ($8.99), Disco Elysium ($9.99), The Séance of Blake Manor ($14.99), Strange Horticulture ($6.39), or 2025 GOTY contender, Blue Prince ($19.79), at a steep discount.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/863503/apple-mac-mini-m4-lg-c5-oled-tv-deal-sale","imageUrl":"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Mac-Mini-M4-Deal.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T15:38:25.000Z","sourceName":"The Verge","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Small footprint.

That’s a 36 percent jump from the company’s previous outlook, published just seven months earlier. But there are severe constraints in power availability, material, equipment, and—perhaps most significantly—a lack of engineers, technicians, and skilled craftsmen that could turn the data center boom into a bust. The power grid engineering workforce is currently shrinking, and data center operators are also hurting for trained electrical engineers. Laura Laltrello, the chief operating officer for Applied Digital, says demand has accelerated for civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers, as well as construction management and oversight positions in recent months. (Applied Digital is a data center developer and operator that is building two data center campuses near Harwood, North Dakota that will require 1.4 GW of power when completed.) The growing demand for skilled workers has forced her company to widen the recruitment perimeter. “As we anticipate a shortage of traditional engineering talent, we are sourcing from diverse industries,” says Laltrello. “We are finding experts who understand power and cooling from sectors like nuclear energy, the military, and aerospace. Expertise doesn’t have to come from a data center background.” Growing Demand for Data Center Engineers For every engineer needed to design, specify, build, inspect, commission, or run a new AI data center, dozens of other positions are in short supply. According to the Association for Computer Operations and Management’s (AFCOM) State of the Data Center Report 2025, 58 percent of data center managers identified multi-skilled data center operators as the top area of growth, while 50 percent signaled increasing demand for data center engineers. Security specialists are also a critical need. Through the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for almost 400,000 more construction workers by 2033. By far the biggest needs are in power infrastructure, electricians, plumbing and HVAC, and roughly 17,500 electrical and electronics engineers. These categories directly map to the skills required to design, build, commission, and operate modern data centers. “The challenge is not simply the absolute number of workers available, but the timing and intensity of demand,” says Bill Kleyman, author of the AFCOM report and the CEO of AI infrastructure firm Apolo. “Data centers are expanding at the same time that utilities, manufacturing, renewables, grid infrastructure, and construction are all competing for the same skilled labor pool and AI is amplifying this pressure.” Data center developers like Lancium and construction firms like Crusoe face enormous demands to build faster, bigger, and more power-dense facilities. For example, they’re developing the Stargate project in Abilene, Texas for Oracle and OpenAI. The project has two buildings that went live in October of 2025, with another six scheduled for completion by the middle of 2026. The entire AI data center campus, once completed, will require 1.2 GW of power. Michael McNamara, the CEO of Lancium, says that in one year his company can currently build enough AI data center infrastructure to require one gigawatt of power. Big tech firms, he says, want this raised to 1 GW a quarter and eventually 1 GW per month or less. That kind of ramp up of construction pace calls for tens of thousands more engineers. The shortage of engineering talent is paralleled by persistent staffing shortages in data center operations and facility management professionals, electrical and mechanical technicians, high-voltage and power systems engineers, skilled HVAC technicians with experience in high-density or liquid cooling, and construction specialists familiar with complex mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) integration, says Matthew Hawkins, the director of education for Uptime Institute. “Demand for each category is rising significantly faster than supply,” says Hawkins. Technical colleges and applied education programs are among the most effective engines for workforce growth in the data center industry. They focus on hands on skills, facilities operations, power and cooling systems, and real-world job readiness. With so many new data centers being built in Texas, workforce programs are popping up all over that state. One example is the SMU Lyle School of Engineering’s Master of Science in Datacenter Systems Engineering (MS DSE) in Dallas. The program blends electrical engineering, IT, facilities management, business continuity, and cybersecurity. There is also a 12-week AI data center technician program at Dallas College and a similar program at Texas State Technical College near Waco. “Technical colleges are driving the charge in bringing new talent to an industry undergoing exponential growth with an almost infinite appetite for skilled workers,” says Wendy Schuchart, an association manager at AFCOM. Vendors and industry associations are actively addressing the talent gap too. Microsoft’s Datacenter Academy is a public-private partnership involving community colleges in regions where Microsoft operates data center facilities. Google supports local nonprofits and colleges offering training in IT and data center operations, and Amazon offers data center apprenticeships. The Siemens Educates America program has surpassed 32,000 apprenticeships across 32 states, 36 labs, and 72 partner industry labor organizations. The company has committed to training 200,000 electricians and electrical manufacturing workers by 2030. Similarly, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) operates the Electrical Training Alliance; the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) offers ToolingU-SME, aimed at expanding the manufacturing workforce; and Uptime Institute Education programs look to accelerate the readiness of technicians and operators. “Every university we speak with is thinking about this challenge and shifting its curriculum to prepare students for the future of digital infrastructure,” said Laltrello. “The best way to predict the future is to build it.”","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-data-centers-engineers-jobs","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aero-gas-turbines-being-installed-in-a-desert-like-landscape.jpg?id=62826721&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T14:00:01.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"The AI data center construction boom continues unabated, with the demand for power in the United States potentially reaching 106 gigawatts by 2035, according to a December report from research and analysis company BloombergNEF.

The pairing process depends on the platform in use although the basics remain the same. Once the AirPods are placed in pairing mode, most devices detect them quickly and handle the remaining steps in the background. The guide below explains how to pair AirPods with Apple products, how the process differs on newer iPhones that support H2 features and how to connect them to non-Apple devices. How to pair AirPods with Apple devices Apple builds AirPods to pair almost instantly with devices in its own ecosystem. Opening the charging case near an unlocked iPhone or iPad usually brings up an on-screen prompt. Tapping Connect links the earbuds to the device and to every other Apple product signed into the same iCloud account. After that, switching between devices is automatic. Audio output follows the active device as long as each product is using updated software and is signed in with the same Apple ID. If the pairing prompt does not appear, there are a few simple checks that help things move along. Opening the Control Center and selecting the audio output menu confirms whether the AirPods already appear as an available device. If they are listed there, choosing them establishes the connection. If they do not appear, opening the Settings app and checking Bluetooth usually reveals whether the AirPods are in range or already recognized. Opening the case while viewing the Bluetooth menu often triggers the pairing card once more. The process is similar across Apple Watch and Mac. When the AirPods are already linked to an iPhone, they tend to show up automatically on a paired Apple Watch. On Mac, opening System Settings and viewing the Bluetooth section reveals the same device list seen on an iPhone. Selecting the AirPods from that list completes the connection and also syncs the pairing status back to every other Apple device using the same account. Enhanced pairing with newer iPhones Some newer iPhones support features enabled by the H2 chip used in newer AirPods models. With compatible AirPods, models such as iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and the iPhone 16 lineup tend to deliver a faster and more responsive setup experience. When an AirPods case is opened near one of these phones, the device quickly detects the earbuds and displays the pairing card with little delay. This also tends to speed up transitions between devices and improves reliability when switching audio sources. If the fast pairing prompt does not appear on a newer iPhone, reopening the case while the phone is unlocked is usually enough to reinitiate the process. It also helps to confirm that Bluetooth is turned on. Placing the AirPods back in the case for a few seconds and trying again will often reset the pairing state if the earbuds were connected elsewhere. AirPods Pro 3 Engadget How to put AirPods into pairing mode Every AirPods model supports a manual pairing mode. This is essential when linking the earbuds to devices outside the Apple ecosystem, or when the automatic prompt fails to appear on an iPhone or Mac. On older AirPods models, pairing mode is activated by opening the lid and pressing and holding the setup button on the back of the case until the LED light flashes white. Newer models, including AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, use a touch-based method instead. With the lid open, tapping the area near the LED light places the earbuds into pairing mode. Leaving the lid open keeps the AirPods discoverable for nearby devices. Closing the case ends the process and requires it to be repeated if the device fails to detect them. Pairing mode does not remove any previous connections. It simply makes the AirPods available to new devices, which is helpful when switching between ecosystems. However, connecting to a new device usually takes priority. If the AirPods are already linked to something else that is nearby, turning off Bluetooth on the previously connected device prevents interference and helps the new device detect them more easily. How to pair AirPods with Android devices Although AirPods are designed for Apple hardware, they function like any other Bluetooth earbuds on Android. Opening the case and placing the AirPods in pairing mode allows Android phones to detect them through the standard Bluetooth menu. The earbuds appear in the list of available devices and selecting them initiates the connection. Once paired, AirPods work for calls and media playback. Some features, such as automatic ear detection and battery status indicators, may require a third-party app on Android and are not supported at a system level. Features such as spatial audio and device switching remain exclusive to Apple’s ecosystem but day-to-day performance is consistent on Android. If the AirPods fail to appear, refreshing the Bluetooth device list on the Android phone usually helps. Making sure the earbuds are still in pairing mode is essential since the white LED indicator stops flashing after a short period. Reopening the case and holding the button again, or tapping on the front for newer models, restores discoverability. How to pair AirPods with Windows laptops Windows 11 handles AirPods as a regular audio device. Opening the Bluetooth and Devices menu in System Settings displays a list of nearby accessories. With the AirPods in pairing mode, the laptop should detect them and display them as an audio device. Selecting them completes the process and adds the earbuds to the device’s known accessories. Windows generally reconnects to AirPods automatically on future sessions as long as Bluetooth remains enabled. If the earbuds do not appear in the list, toggling Bluetooth off and back on helps the system refresh the device scan. Checking whether the AirPods are already linked to a different device is another useful step. Windows sometimes struggles to take over a connection when the earbuds remain in range of a previously paired phone so disabling Bluetooth on the other device often resolves the issue. Troubleshooting common pairing issues Most pairing problems come down to the AirPods not being in discoverable mode or being connected to another device nearby. Resetting the earbuds solves many problems. On AirPods models with a setup button, placing the AirPods in the case, leaving the lid open and holding the button until the LED turns amber then white restores the factory pairing state. On newer models without a physical button, place the AirPods in the case, close the lid for about 30 seconds, then open it and quickly tap the front of the case three times. The status light should then flash amber and then white, to indicate that the reset is complete. This clears previous connections and makes the AirPods behave as if they are new out of the box. Low battery levels can also interrupt pairing. Ensuring both the earbuds and the case have enough charge prevents unexpected disconnections during setup. Interference from other wireless accessories affects pairing on crowded networks. Moving to a quieter spot or turning off surrounding Bluetooth devices helps the AirPods stand out when scanning. AirPods are built to pair quickly with Apple devices but they also integrate smoothly with other platforms. Keeping the earbuds in pairing mode and confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on the device in use ensures a smooth setup every time. Once connected, the AirPods tend to remember the device and reconnect whenever they are nearby which keeps day-to-day use simple regardless of the platform.

However, even an expert review is subjective, and there's a chance CyberGhost will not work for you. If that’s the case, here's how to cancel your subscription. How to stop your CyberGhost subscription renewing Cancelling your CyberGhost subscription won't end it right away, unless you delete your account or get the refund (I'll explain how to do both of those later). Instead, the way to cancel CyberGhost is to stop your subscription from renewing at the end of each billing period. Once you've done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends. The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section. Open your browser and go to cyberghostvpn.com. At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled My Account. Enter your username and password if you aren't logged in already. Look at the top-right corner of the new screen and click the CyberGhost logo next to your email address. From the drop-down menu, select Subscriptions. Find the subscription you want to cancel and select Cancel Subscription. When prompted, click Continue to Cancel. Click the logo at top-right, then click Subscriptions to manage auto-renewal. Sam Chapman for Engadget This will turn off automatic billing for your account. The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term. If you're within the refund period — 14 days for a monthly subscription and 45 days for all others — you can now request your money back. How to cancel CyberGhost if you subscribed through an app store When you subscribe to an app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the store handles the billing; the app provider doesn't process the money itself. If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you'll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here's how to do it. If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you'll need to cancel through your Apple ID. Here are the steps. Open the Settings app on your home screen. At the top of the Settings menu, you'll see your name. Tap it. In your Apple Account menu, tap Subscriptions. Scroll until you find your CyberGhost subscription, then tap on it. Tap the words Cancel Subscription, then follow the prompts. Here's what to do if you subscribed through the Google Play store. Similar to the Apple process, you'll go through the list of subscriptions on your profile. Open the Google Play Store app. Tap the circle in the top-right corner with the first letter of your name. Find the Payments & Subscriptions menu and tap on it. On the next menu that appears, tap Subscriptions. Scroll down until you find your CyberGhost subscription. Tap on it, then click Cancel Subscription. Follow the prompts to complete cancellation. How to delete your CyberGhost account Before you set out to delete your CyberGhost account altogether, make sure you've cancelled auto-renew first by following the steps in the previous section. If you don't, you might still be charged for the subscription you're not using, and it's a huge hassle to end that without an account. Once you've done that, log into your account on cyberghostvpn.com and click on your account profile at the top-right, just like when you canceled auto-renewal. Below the username/password window and the message about an activation key, you'll see the words Delete My Account in tiny letters. How to find the button that deletes your CyberGhost account. Sam Chapman for Engadget Click on them. On the page that appears, select Delete My Account again. Follow any more prompts you're given to annihilate your username for good (note that you can't use it again afterwards). How to get a refund from CyberGhost To get a refund on your CyberGhost subscription, you have to be inside the window for the plan you chose. With a monthly plan, the refund period is 14 days. For all other plans, it's 45 days. If this time has elapsed, there's unfortunately no way to get your money back. If you are within the refund period, you can get your money by sending a request through customer support. You can email support@cyberghost.ro, submit a ticket through this link or open a live chat conversation by clicking the Live Chat button at the bottom-right of any page on cyberghostvpn.com. No matter what method you choose, the conversation will go faster if you have your order number on-hand — check your inbox if you don't know it. Start a live chat conversation by clicking the live chat button at the bottom-right of any screen on CyberGhost's website. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you went through an app store, you'll need to request your money back from that platform instead. Apple and Google Play handle their own monetary transactions, which means they also process refunds. Best CyberGhost alternatives After you've cancelled and/or deleted CyberGhost out of your life, you still need a VPN; the benefits of masking your IP address and changing your virtual location don't go anywhere. You can check out my best list (linked at the top) or best free VPN roundup for ideas, or check out the review for my favorite service, Proton VPN. Proton VPN is my top choice because of its focus on user freedoms and attention to quality in everything it does. If you're willing to pay a bit more for extreme simplicity and total reliability, ExpressVPN is ideal for beginners. If you're a speed demon and just want to keep your downloads fast, go with Surfshark.

Once you've done that, you can keep using CyberGhost until your current period ends. The following steps will cancel auto-renewal if you got CyberGhost through its website. If you bought it through an app store instead, see the next section. Open your browser and go to cyberghostvpn.com. At the top-right of the screen, click the box labeled My Account. Enter your username and password if you aren't logged in already. Look at the top-right corner of the new screen and click the CyberGhost logo next to your email address. From the drop-down menu, select Subscriptions. Find the subscription you want to cancel and select Cancel Subscription. When prompted, click Continue to Cancel. Click the logo at top-right, then click Subscriptions to manage auto-renewal. Sam Chapman for Engadget This will turn off automatic billing for your account. The next time you would have been billed, your subscription will expire. You can resubscribe by purchasing another term. If you're within the refund period — 14 days for a monthly subscription and 45 days for all others — you can now request your money back. How to cancel CyberGhost if you subscribed through an app store When you subscribe to an app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the store handles the billing; the app provider doesn't process the money itself. If you bought CyberGhost through an app store and want to cancel, you'll have to ask the app store in question, not CyberGhost. Here's how to do it. If you subscribed through the Apple App Store, you'll need to cancel through your Apple ID. Here are the steps. Open the Settings app on your home screen. At the top of the Settings menu, you'll see your name. Tap it. In your Apple Account menu, tap Subscriptions. Scroll until you find your CyberGhost subscription, then tap on it. Tap the words Cancel Subscription, then follow the prompts. Here's what to do if you subscribed through the Google Play store. Similar to the Apple process, you'll go through the list of subscriptions on your profile. Open the Google Play Store app. Tap the circle in the top-right corner with the first letter of your name. Find the Payments & Subscriptions menu and tap on it. On the next menu that appears, tap Subscriptions. Scroll down until you find your CyberGhost subscription. Tap on it, then click Cancel Subscription. Follow the prompts to complete cancellation. How to delete your CyberGhost account Before you set out to delete your CyberGhost account altogether, make sure you've cancelled auto-renew first by following the steps in the previous section. If you don't, you might still be charged for the subscription you're not using, and it's a huge hassle to end that without an account. Once you've done that, log into your account on cyberghostvpn.com and click on your account profile at the top-right, just like when you canceled auto-renewal. Below the username/password window and the message about an activation key, you'll see the words Delete My Account in tiny letters. How to find the button that deletes your CyberGhost account. Sam Chapman for Engadget Click on them. On the page that appears, select Delete My Account again. Follow any more prompts you're given to annihilate your username for good (note that you can't use it again afterwards). How to get a refund from CyberGhost To get a refund on your CyberGhost subscription, you have to be inside the window for the plan you chose. With a monthly plan, the refund period is 14 days. For all other plans, it's 45 days. If this time has elapsed, there's unfortunately no way to get your money back. If you are within the refund period, you can get your money by sending a request through customer support. You can email support@cyberghost.ro, submit a ticket through this link or open a live chat conversation by clicking the Live Chat button at the bottom-right of any page on cyberghostvpn.com. No matter what method you choose, the conversation will go faster if you have your order number on-hand — check your inbox if you don't know it. Start a live chat conversation by clicking the live chat button at the bottom-right of any screen on CyberGhost's website. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you went through an app store, you'll need to request your money back from that platform instead. Apple and Google Play handle their own monetary transactions, which means they also process refunds. Best CyberGhost alternatives After you've cancelled and/or deleted CyberGhost out of your life, you still need a VPN; the benefits of masking your IP address and changing your virtual location don't go anywhere. You can check out my best list (linked at the top) or best free VPN roundup for ideas, or check out the review for my favorite service, Proton VPN. Proton VPN is my top choice because of its focus on user freedoms and attention to quality in everything it does. If you're willing to pay a bit more for extreme simplicity and total reliability, ExpressVPN is ideal for beginners. If you're a speed demon and just want to keep your downloads fast, go with Surfshark.

The announcement was the first reported metric reflecting the rollout of the law, which is being closely watched by several other countries weighing whether the regulation can be a blueprint for protecting children from the harms of social media, or a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges of such attempts. The law required 10 social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit, to prevent users under 16 from accessing their services. Under the law, which came into force in December, failure by the companies to take \"reasonable steps\" to remove underage users could lead to fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars, about $33 million. [...] The number of removed accounts offered only a limited picture of the ban's impact. Many teenagers have said in the weeks since the law took effect that they were able to get around the ban by lying about their age, or that they could easily bypass verification systems. The regulator tasked with enforcing and tracking the law, the eSafety Commissioner, did not release a detailed breakdown beyond announcing that the companies had \"removed access\" to about 4.7 million accounts belonging to children under 16. Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, said this week that it had removed almost 550,000 accounts of users younger than 16 before the ban came into effect. \"Change doesn't happen overnight,\" said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. \"But these early signs show it's important we've acted to make this change.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/01/17/0440228/nearly-5-million-accounts-removed-under-australias-new-social-media-ban","imageUrl":"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T13:00:00.000Z","sourceName":"Slashdot","sourceType":"community","text":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: Nearly five million social media accounts belonging to Australian teenagers have been deactivated or removed, a month after a landmark law barring those younger than 16 from using the services took effect, the government said on Thursday.

Several neat-looking games arrived this week, we got release dates for several others that I'm really looking forward to and a brand-new Steam festival was announced. The Love, Romance, and Heartbreak Debutante Ball is said to be the first Valentine's Day-themed Steam festival. It'll run from February 13 to 20 and feature more than 100 games, including discounts and demos. A showcase will take place on February 13 at 1PM ET on the Sunny Demeanor Games YouTube channel too. Organizers say the festival includes a wide variety of games about love, including RPGs, puzzle games and (naturally) visual novels. You might play as a cat or someone trying to fish an engagement ring out of a claw machine, as a secret agent or a couple that's run off to another planet. I'm intrigued! There will be some NSFW games involved, for what it's worth. New releases Quarantine Zone: The Last Check seems like a 3D version of Papers Please but with zombies. At a checkpoint amid a zombie outbreak, your mission is to screen survivors for signs of infection. If you're unsure of their status, you can send an individual to quarantine for further observation or a lab for additional screening. Otherwise, you can let them in or send them to \"liquidation.\" Get things wrong and it could spell disaster, but at least you have a sidearm (and a weaponized drone) to help you deal with sticky situations. It looks like there's a lot going on in Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, which is from Brigada Games and publisher Devolver Digital. There are base and resource management aspects as well. It's out now on Steam (usually $20, but there's a 10 percent discount until January 26) and PC Game Pass. Air Hares seems to draw inspiration from classic top-down shoot-'em-ups. But instead of simply blowing up countless ships, your mission is to restore farmland. You'll fire seeds and water to turn barren land into fertile carrot fields. There are still enemies to contend with — you (and perhaps a co-op partner) can dodge and ram them as you try to protect the land. Expect boss battles, too. I really like the aesthetic here. It has a '90s-style cartoon look (I suddenly really want a modern Bucky O'Hare game). Also, the song from the trailer is going to live in my head for weeks. Husband-and-wife team Tim and Megan Bungeroth created Air Hares over six years with the help of several contributors. According to a press release, the game is \"inspired by the creators’ personal journey with infertility and the idea of creating life rather than destroying it.\" Air Hares is out now on Steam. It typically costs $9, but there's a 20 percent discount until January 28. Luckshot Games' Big Hops looks like my kind of 3D platformer: joyous and playful. As a young frog who has been kidnapped, you'll try to find airship parts for a raccoon who has promised to help get you home. There are tons of movement mechanics here, and Hop's tongue plays a major role in those. You can use it to swing across gaps, hookshot your way to higher platforms and solve puzzles. Big Hops is out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch and PS5 for $20. The Switch and Steam versions have a 10 percent launch discount until January 19. Cassette Boy is a pixel-art game that might appear to be a 2D exploration puzzler, but there's more going on here. You can rotate the world to discover new secrets and hide enemies and hazards from view so you can move past them. If you can't see something on your screen, it doesn't exist. There's a bit of a Fez influence here, it would appear. Wonderland Kazakiri and publisher Pocketpair are behind this one, which I'm looking forward to checking out when I have a chance. Cassette Boy is available on Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S for $13. Upcoming I really enjoyed the demo for Aerial_Knight’s DropShot (as well as Aerial_Knight’s previous games). I'm for sure going to be playing the full game when it hits PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store on February 17. This is a single-player first-person shooter in which you're skydiving with finger guns. You compete with four enemies to grab the only available parachute as you're falling through the air. Rounds are fast-paced too, generally lasting under a minute. Point-and-click adventure Earth Must Die has been on my radar for a while and we'll all get a chance to try it soon. It's designed to be a playable cartoon (with a runtime of about eight hours) and it has an art style to match. The cast is pretty stellar, with Ben Starr (Final Fantasy XVI, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II), Joel Fry (Our Flag Means Death) and a whole load of British comedy figures on board. There's a demo available on Steam now and the full game — from Size Five Games and publisher No More Robots — will land on January 27. Let's wrap things up for this week something very silly-looking from Monster Shop Games. Pie in the Sky is a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater-inspired action arcade game in which you play as a magpie that terrorizes bystanders. You can knock people off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, ram kids off of scooters, actually go skateboarding and, uh, cause havoc from above. In classic THPS-style, there are hidden areas too. This looks like a fun distraction from [gestures at everything]. Pie is the Sky will swoop onto Steam on February 2.

The case could determine whether federal rules preempt state failure-to-warn claims without deciding whether glyphosate causes cancer. The Los Angeles Times reports: Some studies have found it is a likely carcinogen, and others concluded it does not pose a true cancer risk for humans. However, the court may free Monsanto and Bayer, its parent company, from legal claims from more than 100,000 plaintiffs who sued over their cancer diagnosis. The legal dispute involves whether the federal regulatory laws shield the company from being sued under state law for failing to warn consumers.

It was jarringly polite. “We are contacting you because you have used Vastaamo’s therapy and/or psychiatric services,” it read. “Unfortunately, we have to ask you to pay to keep your personal information safe.” The sender demanded €200 in bitcoin within 24 hours, otherwise the price would go up to €500 within 48 hours. “If we still do not receive our money after this, your information will be published for everyone to see, including your name, address, phone number, social security number and detailed records containing transcripts of your conversations with Vastaamo’s therapists or psychiatrists.” Continue reading...","tags":[]},{"id":"8bce7fb0d65bf74194f1fed8","title":"Petlibro Discount Codes and Deals: Save Up to 50%","summary":"Save on Petlibro essentials, including automatic feeders, water fountains, and accessories to keep cats and dogs fed, hydrated, and comfortable every day.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/petlibro-discount-code","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T06:00:00.000Z","sourceName":"Wired","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Save on Petlibro essentials, including automatic feeders, water fountains, and accessories to keep cats and dogs fed, hydrated, and comfortable every day.","tags":[]},{"id":"1129a0d437165012d1fa8501","title":"How ClickHouse handles strings","summary":"Comments","url":"https://rushter.com/blog/clickhouse-strings","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T05:33:17.000Z","sourceName":"Lobsters","sourceType":"community","text":"Comments","tags":[]},{"id":"8467425cb6bd06c7a77265fb","title":"Counterfactual evaluation for recommendation systems","summary":"Comments","url":"https://eugeneyan.com/writing/counterfactual-evaluation","publishedAt":"2026-01-17T05:20:20.000Z","sourceName":"Hacker News","sourceType":"community","text":"Comments","tags":[]},{"id":"bc3b46fbbb93d1efa6bfdc40","title":"[D] Irreproducible KDD Paper?","summary":"So I came across a 2025 KDD paper whose idea is pretty simple and not too novel in my opinion. The paper shared a code link that was broken. But the same paper was rejected from ICLR but had shared the code there. They primarily did experiments on 2 datasets that were public following some training/credentialing steps. I was planning to submit something to KDD this year trying to improve upon this work. I was thinking of simply following their experimental procedure for my method and use the results of all models reported in their paper as baselines. So I emailed the corresponding author who immediately directed the first author to contact me. The first author then shared a Github repo that was created 3 weeks ago. However, the experimental setup was still very vague (like the first preprocessing script assumed that a file is already available while the raw data is spread across directories and there was no clarity about what folders were even used). Initially the author was pretty fast in responding to my emails (took maybe 10-15 mins or so), but as soon as I asked for the script to create this file, they first said that they cannot share the script as the data is behind the credentialing step.

According to the ruling, the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data. \"It is expected that OCLC will use the injunction to motivate third-party intermediaries to take action against Anna's Archive,\" reports TorrentFreak. From the report: Yesterday, a federal court in Ohio issued a default judgment and permanent injunction against the site's unidentified operator(s). This order was requested by OCLC, which owns the proprietary WorldCat database that was scraped and published by Anna's Archive more than two years ago. OCLC initially demanded millions of dollars in damages but eventually dropped this request, focusing on taking the site down through an injunction that would also apply to intermediaries. \"Anna's Archive's flagrantly illegal actions have damaged and continue to irreparably damage OCLC. As such, issuance of a permanent injunction is necessary to stop any further harm to OCLC,\" the request read.

However, with the right type of court order, third-party services such as hosting companies and domain registrars might come along. The permanent injunction, issued by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson yesterday, does not mention any third-party services by name.

Specifically, the site's operator and these third parties are prohibited from scraping WorldCat data, storing or distributing the data on Anna's Archive websites, and encouraging others to store, use or share this data. Additionally, the site has to delete all WorldCat data, which also includes all torrents. Judge Watson denied the default judgment for 'unjust enrichment' and 'tortious interference.' However, he granted the order based on the 'trespass to chattels' and 'breach of contract' claims. The latter is particularly noteworthy, as the judge ruled that because Anna's Archive is a 'sophisticated party' that scraped the site daily, it had constructive notice of the terms and entered into a 'browsewrap' agreement simply by using the service.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024. These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. The best MacBook Air deals M4 MacBook Air In March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date. 13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) Where to Buy: $999 $799.99 at Amazon $999 $799 at Best Buy $999 $889 at B&H Photo 15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) Where to Buy: $1199 $999.99 at Amazon $1199 $1099 at B&H Photo $1199 $999 at Best Buy The best MacBook Pro deals M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option. Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available for $1,299 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,249 ($250 off), which is $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday. Apple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4) Where to Buy: $1599 $1299 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro Where to Buy: $2499 $1749 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $1999 $1999 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Apple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro) Where to Buy: $2499 $2249.99 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD) M5 MacBook Pro Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts. The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. MacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025) Where to Buy: $1599 $1449 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $1599 $1449 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) $1599 $1449 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) The best Mac Mini deals The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value. M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep. In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100. In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($100 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $689 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,269 ($130 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024. These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent. But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available. The best MacBook Air deals M4 MacBook Air In March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date. 13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) Where to Buy: $999 $799.99 at Amazon $999 $799 at Best Buy $999 $889 at B&H Photo 15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD) Where to Buy: $1199 $999.99 at Amazon $1199 $1099 at B&H Photo $1199 $999 at Best Buy The best MacBook Pro deals M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option. Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available for $1,299 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months. The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,249 ($250 off), which is $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts. The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.

The [klein] series, released yesterday, includes two primary parameter counts: 4 billion (4B) and 9 billion (9B). The model weights are available on Hugging Face and code on Github. While the larger models in the FLUX.2 family ([max] and [pro]), released in November of 2025, chase the limits of photorealism and \"grounding search\" capabilities, [klein] is designed specifically for consumer hardware and latency-critical workflows. In great news for enterprises, the 4B version is available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning they — or any organization or developer — can use the [klein] models for their commercial purposes without paying BFL or any intermediaries a dime. However, a number of AI image and media creation platforms including Fal.ai have begun offering it for extremely low cost as well through their application programming interfaces (APIs) and as a direct-to-user tool. Already, it's won strong praise from early users for its speed. What it lacks for in overall image quality, it seems to make up for in its fast generation capability, open license, affordability and small footprint — benefitting enterprises who want to run image models on their own hardware or at extremely low cost. So how did BFL do it and how can it benefit you? Read on to learn more. The \"Pareto Frontier\" of Latency The technical philosophy behind [klein] is what BFL documentation describes as defining the \"Pareto frontier\" for quality versus latency. In simple terms, they have attempted to squeeze the maximum possible visual fidelity into a model small enough to run on a home gaming PC without a noticeable lag. The performance metrics released by the company paint a picture of a model built for interactivity rather than just batch generation. According to Black Forest Labs' official figures, the [klein] models are capable of generating or editing images in under 0.5 seconds on modern hardware. Even on standard consumer GPUs like an RTX 3090 or 4070, the 4B model is designed to fit comfortably within approximately 13GB of VRAM. This speed is achieved through \"distillation,\" a process where a larger, more complex model \"teaches\" a smaller, more efficient one to approximate its outputs in fewer steps. The distilled [klein] variants require only four steps to generate an image. This effectively turns the generation process from a coffee-break task into a near-instantaneous one, enabling what BFL describes on X (formerly Twitter) as \"developing ideas from 0 → 1\" in real-time. Under the Hood: Unified Architecture Historically, image generation and image editing have often required different pipelines or complex adapters (like ControlNets). FLUX.2 [klein] attempts to unify these. The architecture natively supports text-to-image, single-reference editing, and multi-reference composition without needing to swap models. According to the documentation released on GitHub, the models support: Multi-Reference Editing: Users can upload up to four reference images (or ten in the playground) to guide the style or structure of the output. Hex-Code Color Control: A frequent pain point for designers is getting \"that exact shade of red.\" The new models accept specific hex codes in prompts (e.g., #800020) to force precise color rendering. Structured Prompting: The model parses JSON-like structured inputs for rigorously defined compositions, a feature clearly aimed at programmatic generation and enterprise pipelines. The Licensing Split: Open Weights vs. Open Source For startups and developers building on top of BFL’s tech, understanding the licensing landscape of this release is critical. BFL has adopted a split strategy that separates \"hobbyist/research\" use from \"commercial infrastructure.\" FLUX.2 [klein] 4B: Released under Apache 2.0. This is a permissive free software license that allows for commercial use, modification, and redistribution. If you are building a paid app, a SaaS platform, or a game that integrates AI generation, you can use the 4B model royalty-free. FLUX.2 [klein] 9B & [dev]: Released under the FLUX Non-Commercial License. These weights are open for researchers and hobbyists to download and experiment with, but they cannot be used for commercial applications without a separate agreement. This distinction positions the 4B model as a direct competitor to other open-weights models like Stable Diffusion 3 Medium or SDXL, but with a more modern architecture and a permissive license that removes legal ambiguity for startups. Ecosystem Integration: ComfyUI and Beyond BFL is clearly aware that a model is only as good as the tools that run it. Coinciding with the model drop, the team released official workflow templates for ComfyUI, the node-based interface that has become the standard integrated development environment (IDE) for AI artists. The workflows—specifically image_flux2_klein_text_to_image.json and the editing variants—allow users to drag and drop the new capabilities into existing pipelines immediately. Community reaction on social media has centered on this workflow integration and the speed. In a post on X, the official Black Forest Labs account highlighted the model's ability to \"rapidly explore a specific aesthetic,\" showcasing a video where the style of an image shifted instantly as the user scrubbed through options. Why It Matters For Enterprise AI Decision-Makers The release of FLUX.2 [klein] signals a maturation in the generative AI market, moving past the initial phase of novelty into a period defined by utility, integration, and speed. For Lead AI Engineers who are constantly juggling the need to balance speed with quality, this shift is pivotal. These professionals, who manage the full lifecycle of models from data preparation to deployment, often face the daily challenge of integrating rapidly evolving tools into existing workflows. The availability of a distilled 4B model under an Apache 2.0 license offers a practical solution for those focused on rapid deployment and fine-tuning to achieve specific business goals, allowing them to bypass the latency bottlenecks that typically plague high-fidelity image generation. For Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and automation, the implications are equally significant. These experts are responsible for building scalable AI pipelines and maintaining model integrity across different environments, often while working under strict budget constraints. The lightweight nature of the [klein] family directly addresses the challenge of implementing efficient systems with limited resources. By utilizing a model that fits within consumer-grade VRAM, orchestration specialists can architect cost-effective, local inference pipelines that avoid the heavy operational costs associated with massive proprietary models. Even for the Director of IT Security, the move toward capable, locally runnable open-weight models offers a distinct advantage. Tasked with protecting the organization from cyber threats and managing security operations with limited resources, reliance on external APIs for sensitive creative workflows can be a vulnerability. A high-quality model that runs locally allows security leaders to sanction AI tools that keep proprietary data within the corporate firewall, balancing the operational demands of the business with the robust security measures they are required to uphold.","url":"https://venturebeat.com/technology/black-forest-labs-launches-open-source-flux-2-klein-to-generate-ai-images-in","imageUrl":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/39s3mZmA7qAJ4Ue1uSoxEF/1a59f5a9ba32692d1504d33a127cb172/robot-throw.png?w=300&q=30","publishedAt":"2026-01-16T23:28:00.000Z","sourceName":"VentureBeat","sourceType":"editorial","text":"The German AI startup Black Forest Labs (BFL), founded by former Stability AI engineers, is continuing to build out its suite of open source AI image generators with the release of FLUX.2 [klein], a new pair of small models — one open and one non-commercial — that emphasizes speed and lower compute requirements, with the models generating images in less than a second on a Nvidia GB200.

Instead of training LLMs through next-token prediction, their technique, called internal reinforcement learning (internal RL), steers the model’s internal activations toward developing a high-level step-by-step solution for the input problem. Ultimately, this could provide a scalable path for creating autonomous agents that can handle complex reasoning and real-world robotics without needing constant, manual guidance. The limits of next-token prediction Reinforcement learning plays a key role in post-training LLMs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, the problem lies in the architecture of these models. LLMs are autoregressive, meaning they generate sequences one token at a time. When these models explore new strategies during training, they do so by making small, random changes to the next single token or action. This exposes a deeper limitation: next-token prediction forces models to search for solutions at the wrong level of abstraction, making long-horizon reasoning inefficient even when the model “knows” what to do. This token-by-token approach works well for basic language modeling but breaks down in long-horizon tasks where rewards are sparse. If the model relies solely on random token-level sampling, the probability of stumbling upon the correct multi-step solution is infinitesimally small, \"on the order of one in a million,\" according to the researchers. The issue isn't just that the models get confused; it’s that they get confused at the wrong level. In comments provided to VentureBeat, Yanick Schimpf, a co-author of the paper, notes that in a 20-step task, an agent can get lost in the minute details of a single step, or it can lose track of the overall goal. \"We argue that when facing a problem with some abstract structure... [goal-oriented exploration] is what you want,\" Schimpf said. By solving the problem at the abstract level first, the agent commits to a path, ensuring it doesn't \"get lost in one of the reasoning steps\" and fail to complete the broader workflow. To address this, the field has long looked toward hierarchical reinforcement learning. HRL attempts to solve complex problems by decomposing them into a hierarchy of temporally abstract actions (high-level subroutines that represent different stages of the solution) rather than managing a task as a string of tokens. However, discovering these appropriate subroutines remains a longstanding challenge. Current HRL methods often fail to discover proper policies, frequently \"converging to degenerate options\" that do not represent meaningful behaviors. Even sophisticated modern methods like GRPO (a popular RL algorithm used for sparse-reward tasks) fail in complex environments because they cannot effectively bridge the gap between low-level execution and high-level planning. Steering the LLM's internal thoughts To overcome these limitations, the Google team proposed internal RL. Advanced autoregressive models already \"know\" how to perform complex, multi-step tasks internally, even if they aren't explicitly trained to do so. Because these complex behaviors are hidden inside the model's residual stream (i.e., the numerical values that carry information through the network's layers), the researchers introduced an \"internal neural network controller,\" or metacontroller. Instead of monitoring and changing the output token, the metacontroller controls the model’s behavior by applying changes to the model's internal activations in the middle layers. This nudge steers the model into a specific useful state. The base model then automatically generates the sequence of individual steps needed to achieve that goal because it has already seen those patterns during its initial pretraining. The metacontroller operates through unsupervised learning and does not require human-labeled training examples. Instead, the researchers use a self-supervised framework where the model analyzes a full sequence of behavior and works backward to infer the hidden, high-level intent that best explains the actions. During the internal RL phase, the updates are applied to the metacontroller, which shifts training from next-token prediction to learning high-level actions that can lead to the solution. To understand the practical value of this, consider an enterprise agent tasked with code generation. Today, there is a difficult trade-off: You need \"low temperature\" (predictability) to get the syntax right, but \"high temperature\" (creativity) to solve the logic puzzle. \"Internal RL might facilitate this by allowing the model to explore the space of abstract actions, i.e. structuring logic and method calls, while delegating the token-level realization of those actions to the robust, lower-temperature distribution of the base model,\" Schimpf said. The agent explores the solution without breaking the syntax. The researchers investigated two methods for applying this controller. In the first, the base autoregressive model is pretrained on a behavioral dataset and then frozen, while the metacontroller is trained to steer the frozen model's residual stream. In the second, the metacontroller and the base model are jointly optimized, with parameters of both networks updated simultaneously. Internal RL in action To evaluate the effectiveness of internal RL, the researchers ran experiments across hierarchical environments designed to stump traditional learners. These included a discrete grid world and a continuous control task where a quadrupedal \"ant\" robot must coordinate joint movements. Both environments used sparse rewards with very long action sequences. While baselines like GRPO and CompILE failed to learn the tasks within a million episodes due to the difficulty of credit assignment over long horizons, internal RL achieved high success rates with a small number of training episodes. By choosing high-level goals rather than tiny steps, the metacontroller drastically reduced the search space. This allowed the model to identify which high-level decisions led to success, making credit assignment efficient enough to solve the sparse reward problem. Notably, the researchers found that the \"frozen\" approach was superior. When the base model and metacontroller were co-trained from scratch, the system failed to develop meaningful abstractions. However, applied to a frozen model, the metacontroller successfully discovered key checkpoints without any human labels, perfectly aligning its internal switching mechanism with the ground-truth moments when an agent finished one subgoal and started the next. As the industry currently fixates on reasoning models that output verbose \"chains of thought\" to solve problems, Google’s research points toward a different, perhaps more efficient future. \"Our study joins a growing body of work suggesting that 'internal reasoning' is not only feasible but potentially more efficient than token-based approaches,\" Schimpf said. \"Moreover, these silent 'thoughts' can be decoupled from specific input modalities — a property that could be particularly relevant for the future of multi-modal AI.\" If internal reasoning can be guided without being externalized, the future of AI agents may hinge less on prompting strategies and more on how well we can access and steer what models already represent internally. For enterprises betting on autonomous systems that must plan, adapt, and act over long horizons, that shift could matter more than any new reasoning benchmark.","url":"https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/how-googles-internal-rl-could-unlock-long-horizon-ai-agents","imageUrl":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5G8U6bM1sFhRXpyfrxhyQi/c347e41798d60e69a1c35f7a8003c54b/LLM_reasoning.jpg?w=300&q=30","publishedAt":"2026-01-16T22:41:00.000Z","sourceName":"VentureBeat","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Researchers at Google have developed a technique that makes it easier for AI models to learn complex reasoning tasks that usually cause LLMs to hallucinate or fall apart.

For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place. On the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood. I built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money.

For each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs. Editor's note: This list is up-to-date as of January 2026.

Table of contents Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested What to look for in a VPN VPN FAQs Best VPNs for 2026 Other VPNs we tested The VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.

Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.

Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period. We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for best premium VPN. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue. In our review we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100. The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices. The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.

That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.

I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Findings at a glance Category Notes Installation and UI Windows app has more options and the most sensible organization macOS app is very easy to use, but a bit lacking compared to Windows Android and iOS both have simple main pages and slightly confusing preferences No browser extensions (free proxy doesn't count) Speed Excellent latency tests, with ping times short enough to lead the VPN field Great download and upload speeds on close-in servers Distant servers lag somewhat on both upload and download, bringing down the worldwide average Security Uses WireGuard, IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols, but they aren't all supported on all platforms Blocks IPv6 and prevents WebRTC and DNS leaks Disconnects when switching servers Pricing $12.99 per month $41.94 for 6 months ($6.99 per month) $56.94 for 28 months ($2.03 per month), renewing at the same price for 12 months ($4.79 per month) Seven simultaneous connections Bundles Dedicated IP address for $2.50 per month Privacy policy Anonymizes all personal data Can share data with other Kape subsidiaries, but only if they're based in areas with good privacy laws RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption confirmed by audit Has never given information to police Virtual location change Unblocked Netflix perfectly in five different regions using streaming-optimized servers and WireGuard Server network 125 server locations in 100 countries Good global distribution, with nine locations in South America and six in Africa However, most servers in the southern hemisphere are virtual locations that may not give the best speeds Features Kill switch cannot be turned off except on Windows Split tunneling by app on Android and by URL on Windows Content blocker can only be turned on or off, no customization Large network of torrent-optimized servers and streaming servers Smart Rules automation is both user-friendly and deep Customer support Online help pages are well-written but poorly organized Live chat responds quickly; there is a bot but it's easy to get past Can also submit email tickets through an online portal Background check Founded in 2011 and based in Romania Acquired by Kape Technologies in 2017 Installing, configuring and using CyberGhost CyberGhost gets installation and UI largely right. There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.

I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using. Findings at a glance Category Notes Installation and UI Windows app has more options and the most sensible organization macOS app is very easy to use, but a bit lacking compared to Windows Android and iOS both have simple main pages and slightly confusing preferences No browser extensions (free proxy doesn't count) Speed Excellent latency tests, with ping times short enough to lead the VPN field Great download and upload speeds on close-in servers Distant servers lag somewhat on both upload and download, bringing down the worldwide average Security Uses WireGuard, IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols, but they aren't all supported on all platforms Blocks IPv6 and prevents WebRTC and DNS leaks Disconnects when switching servers Pricing $12.99 per month $41.94 for 6 months ($6.99 per month) $56.94 for 28 months ($2.03 per month), renewing at the same price for 12 months ($4.79 per month) Seven simultaneous connections Bundles Dedicated IP address for $2.50 per month Privacy policy Anonymizes all personal data Can share data with other Kape subsidiaries, but only if they're based in areas with good privacy laws RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption confirmed by audit Has never given information to police Virtual location change Unblocked Netflix perfectly in five different regions using streaming-optimized servers and WireGuard Server network 125 server locations in 100 countries Good global distribution, with nine locations in South America and six in Africa However, most servers in the southern hemisphere are virtual locations that may not give the best speeds Features Kill switch cannot be turned off except on Windows Split tunneling by app on Android and by URL on Windows Content blocker can only be turned on or off, no customization Large network of torrent-optimized servers and streaming servers Smart Rules automation is both user-friendly and deep Customer support Online help pages are well-written but poorly organized Live chat responds quickly; there is a bot but it's easy to get past Can also submit email tickets through an online portal Background check Founded in 2011 and based in Romania Acquired by Kape Technologies in 2017 Installing, configuring and using CyberGhost CyberGhost gets installation and UI largely right. There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.

Since the fall of 2024, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called Claude Cowork. The company is billing Cowork as \"a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.\" After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork.

Another example: you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses.

For that reason, Anthropic suggests it's best to give \"very clear\" guidance to Claude. Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite seemingly limited adoption. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier. Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey Claude Max subscription.

It reportedly continues to produce “nudified” deepfakes of real people. And now, Ashley St. Clair, a conservative political strategist and mother of one of Elon Musk’s 14 children, has sued xAI for nonconsensual sexualized images of her that Grok allegedly produced. In the court filing, St. Clair accused xAI’s Grok chatbot of creating and disseminating deepfakes of her “as a child stripped down to a string bikini, and as an adult in sexually explicit poses, covered in semen, or wearing only bikini floss.” In some cases, the chatbot allegedly produced bikini-clad deepfakes of St. Clair based on a photo of her as a 14-year-old. “People took pictures of me as a child and undressed me. There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over, and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now,” she said. “I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated,” St. Clair told The Guardian. “These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet, and now it is on a mainstream social media app.” St. Clair said that, after she reported the images to X, the social platform replied that the content didn’t violate any policies. In addition, she claims that X left the images posted for up to seven days after she reported them. St. Clair said xAI then retaliated against her by creating more digitally undressed deepfakes of her, therefore “making [St. Clair] the laughingstock of the social media platform.” She accused the company of then revoking her X Premium subscription, verification checkmark and ability to monetize content on the platform. “xAI further banned [her] from repurchasing Premium,” St. Clair’s court filing states. On Wednesday, X said it changed its policies so that Grok would no longer generate sexualized images of children or nonconsensual nudity “in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal.” However, the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to undress and sexualize photos when prompted to do so. Neither Apple nor Google has removed the Grok app despite explicit policy violations. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Apple and Google have thus far done, well, absolutely nothing. Despite the multi-week outrage over the deepfakes — and an open letter from 28 advocacy groups — neither company has removed the X or Grok apps from their app stores. Both the App Store and Play Store have policies that explicitly prohibit apps that generate such content. Neither Apple nor Google has responded to multiple requests for comment from Engadget. That includes a follow-up email sent on Friday, regarding the Grok app continuing to “nudify” photos of real women and other people. While Apple and Google fail to act, many governments have done the opposite. On Monday, Malaysia and Indonesia banned Grok. The same day, UK regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X. California opened one on Wednesday.

It reportedly continues to produce “nudified” deepfakes of real people. And now, Ashley St. Clair, a conservative political strategist and mother of one of Elon Musk’s 14 children, has sued xAI for nonconsensual sexualized images of her that Grok allegedly produced. In the court filing, St. Clair accused xAI’s Grok chatbot of creating and disseminating deepfakes of her “as a child stripped down to a string bikini, and as an adult in sexually explicit poses, covered in semen, or wearing only bikini floss.” In some cases, the chatbot allegedly produced bikini-clad deepfakes of St. Clair based on a photo of her as a 14-year-old. “People took pictures of me as a child and undressed me. There’s one where they undressed me and bent me over, and in the background is my child’s backpack that he’s wearing right now,” she said. “I am also seeing images where they add bruises to women, beat them up, tie them up, mutilated,” St. Clair told The Guardian. “These sickos used to have to go to the dark depths of the internet, and now it is on a mainstream social media app.” St. Clair said that, after she reported the images to X, the social platform replied that the content didn’t violate any policies. In addition, she claims that X left the images posted for up to seven days after she reported them. St. Clair said xAI then retaliated against her by creating more digitally undressed deepfakes of her, therefore “making [St. Clair] the laughingstock of the social media platform.” She accused the company of then revoking her X Premium subscription, verification checkmark and ability to monetize content on the platform. “xAI further banned [her] from repurchasing Premium,” St. Clair’s court filing states. On Wednesday, X said it changed its policies so that Grok would no longer generate sexualized images of children or nonconsensual nudity “in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal.” However, the standalone Grok app reportedly continues to undress and sexualize photos when prompted to do so. Neither Apple nor Google has removed the Grok app despite explicit policy violations. Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images Apple and Google have thus far done, well, absolutely nothing. Despite the multi-week outrage over the deepfakes — and an open letter from 28 advocacy groups — neither company has removed the X or Grok apps from their app stores. Both the App Store and Play Store have policies that explicitly prohibit apps that generate such content. Neither Apple nor Google has responded to multiple requests for comment from Engadget. That includes a follow-up email sent on Friday, regarding the Grok app continuing to “nudify” photos of real women and other people. While Apple and Google fail to act, many governments have done the opposite. On Monday, Malaysia and Indonesia banned Grok. The same day, UK regulator Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X. California opened one on Wednesday. The US Senate even passed the Defiance Act for a second time in the wake of the blowback. “If you are a woman, you can’t post a picture, and you can’t speak, or you risk this abuse,” St. Clair told The Guardian. “It’s dangerous, and I believe this is by design.

It was unexpected and delightful to see Lego come up with a way to modernize its bricks without the need for apps, screens or AI. So I was a little surprised this week when the Lego Education group announced its latest initiative is the Computer Science and AI Learning Solution. After all, generative AI feels like the antithesis of Lego’s creative values. But Andrew Silwinski, Lego Education’s head of product experience, was quick to defend Lego’s approach, noting that being fluent in the tools behind AI is not about generating sloppy images or music and more about expanding what it means by teaching computer science. “I think most people should probably know that we started working on this before ChatGPT [got big],” Silwinski told Engadget earlier this week. “Some of the ideas that underline AI are really powerful foundational ideas, regardless of the current frontier model that's out this week. Helping children understand probability and statistics, data quality, algorithmic bias, sensors, machine perception. These are really foundational core ideas that go back to the 1970s.” To that end, Lego Education designed courses for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 that incorporate Lego bricks, additional hardware and lessons tailored to introducing the fundamentals of AI as an extension of existing computer science education. The kits are designed for four students to work together, with teacher oversight. Much of this all comes from learnings Lego found in a study it commissioned showing that teachers often find they don’t have the right resources to teach these subjects. The study showed that half of teachers globally say “current resources leave students bored” while nearly half say “computer science isn’t relatable and doesn’t connect to students’ interests or day to day.” Given kids’ familiarity with Lego and the multiple decades of experience Lego Education has in putting courses like this together, it seems like a logical step to push in this direction. In Lego’s materials about the new courses, AI is far from the only subject covered. Coding, looping code, triggering events and sequences, if/then conditionals and more are all on display through the combination of Lego-built models and other hardware to motorize it. It feels more like a computer science course that also introduces concepts of AI rather than something with an end goal of having kids build a chatbot. In fact, Lego set up a number of “red lines” in terms of how it would introduce AI. “No data can ever go across the internet to us or any other third party,” Silwinski said. “And that's a really hard bar if you know anything about AI.” So instead of going to the cloud, everything had to be able to do local inference on, as Silwinski said, “the 10-year-old Chromebooks you’ll see in classrooms.” He added that “kids can train their own machine learning models, and all of that is happening locally in the classroom, and none of that data ever leaves the student's device.” Lego also says that its lessons never anthropomorphize AI, one of the things that is so common in consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and many more. “One of the things we're seeing a lot of with generative AI tools is children have a tendency to see them as somehow human or almost magical. A lot of it's because of the conversational interface, it abstracts all the mechanics away from the child.” Lego also recognized that it had to build a course that’ll work regardless of a teacher’s fluency in such subjects. So a big part of developing the course was making sure that teachers had the tools they needed to be on top of whatever lessons they’re working on. “When we design and we test the products, we're not the ones testing in the classroom,” Silwinski said. “We give it to a teacher and we provide all of the lesson materials, all of the training, all of the notes, all the presentation materials, everything that they need to be able to teach the lesson.” Lego also took into account the fact that some schools might introduce its students to these things starting in Kindergarten, whereas others might skip to the grade 3-5 or 6-8 sets. To alleviate any bumps in the courses for students or teachers, Lego Education works with school districts and individual schools to make sure there’s an on-ramp for those starting from different places in their fluency. While the idea of “teaching AI” seemed out of character for Lego initially, the approach it’s taking here actually reminds me a bit of Smart Play. With Smart Play, the technology is essentially invisible — kids can just open up a set, start building, and get all the benefits of the new system without having to hook up to an app or a screen. In the same vein, Silwinski said that a lot of the work you can do with the Computer Science and AI kit doesn’t need a screen, particularly the lessons designed for younger kids. And the sets themselves have a mode that acts similar to a mesh, where you connect numerous motors and sensors together to build “incredibly complex interactions and behaviors” without even needing a computer. For educators interested in checking out this latest course, Lego has single kits up for pre-order starting at $339.95; they’ll start shipping in April. That’s the pricing for the K-2 sets, the 3-5 and 6-8 sets are $429.95 and $529.95, respectively. A single kit covers four students. Lego is also selling bundles with six kits, and school districts can also request a quote for bigger orders.

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion. ICRA 2026: 1–5 June 2026, VIENNA Enjoy today’s videos! This is one of the best things I have ever seen. [ Kinetic Intelligent Machine LAB ] After years of aggressive testing and pushing the envelope with U.S. Army and Marine Corps partners, the Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program approaches its conclusion. But the impact of RACER will reverberate far beyond the program’s official end date, leaving a legacy of robust autonomous capabilities ready to transform military operations and inspire a new wave of private-sector investment. [ DARPA ] Best-looking humanoid yet. [ Kawasaki ] COSA (Cognitive OS of Agents) is a physical-world-native Agentic OS that unifies high-level cognition with whole-body motion control, enabling humanoid robots to think while acting in real environments. Powered by COSA, Oli becomes the first humanoid agent with both advanced loco-manipulation and high-level autonomous cognition. [ LimX Dynamics ] Thanks, Jinyan! The 1X World Model’s latest update is a paradigm shift in robot learning: NEO now uses a physics-grounded video model (World Model) to turn any voice or text prompt into fully autonomous action, even for completely novel tasks and objects NEO has never seen before. By leveraging internet-scale video data fine-tuned on real robot experience, NEO can visualize future actions, predict outcomes, and execute them with humanlike understanding–all without prior examples. This marks the critical first step in NEO being able to collect data on its own to master new tasks all by itself. [ 1X ] I’m impressed by the human who was mocapped for this. [ PNDbotics ] We introduce the GuideData Dataset, a collection of qualitative data, focusing on the interactions between guide dog trainers, visually impaired (BLV) individuals, and their guide dogs. The dataset captures a variety of real-world scenarios, including navigating sidewalks, climbing stairs, crossing streets, and avoiding obstacles. By providing this comprehensive dataset, the project aims to advance research in areas such as assistive technologies, robotics, and human-robot interaction, ultimately improving the mobility and safety of visually impaired people. [ DARoS Lab ] Fourier’s desktop Care-Bot prototype is gaining much attention at CES 2026! Even though it’s still in the prototype stage, we couldn’t wait to share these adorable and fun interaction features with you. [ Fourier ] Volcanic gas measurements are critical for understanding eruptive activity. However, harsh terrain, hazardous conditions, and logistical constraints make near-surface data collection extremely challenging. In this work, we present an autonomous legged robotic system for volcanic gas monitoring, validated through real-world deployments on Mount Etna. The system combines a quadruped robot equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a modular autonomy stack, enabling long-distance missions in rough volcanic terrain. [ ETH Zurich RSL ] Humanoid and Siemens successfully completed a POC testing humanoid robots in industrial logistics. This is the first step in the broader partnership between the companies. The POC focused on a tote-to-conveyor destacking task within Siemens’s logistics process. HMND 01 autonomously picked, transported, and placed totes in a live production environment during a two-week on-site deployment at the Siemens Electronics Factory in Erlangen. [ Humanoid ] Four Growers, a category leader in intelligent ag-tech platforms, developed the GR-200 robotic harvesting platform, powered by FANUC’s LR Mate robot. The system combines AI-driven vision and motion planning to identify and harvest ripe tomatoes with quick precision. [ FANUC ] Columbia Engineers built a robot that, for the first time, is able to learn facial lip motions for tasks such as speech and singing. In a new study published in Science Robotics, the researchers demonstrate how their robot used its abilities to articulate words in a variety of languages, and even sing a song out of its AI-generated debut album, “hello world_.” The robot acquired this ability through observational learning rather than via rules. It first learned how to use its 26 facial motors by watching its own reflection in the mirror before learning to imitate human lip motion by watching hours of YouTube videos.

This is one of the best things I have ever seen. [ Kinetic Intelligent Machine LAB ] After years of aggressive testing and pushing the envelope with U.S. Army and Marine Corps partners, the Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program approaches its conclusion. But the impact of RACER will reverberate far beyond the program’s official end date, leaving a legacy of robust autonomous capabilities ready to transform military operations and inspire a new wave of private-sector investment. [ DARPA ] Best-looking humanoid yet. [ Kawasaki ] COSA (Cognitive OS of Agents) is a physical-world-native Agentic OS that unifies high-level cognition with whole-body motion control, enabling humanoid robots to think while acting in real environments. Powered by COSA, Oli becomes the first humanoid agent with both advanced loco-manipulation and high-level autonomous cognition. [ LimX Dynamics ] Thanks, Jinyan! The 1X World Model’s latest update is a paradigm shift in robot learning: NEO now uses a physics-grounded video model (World Model) to turn any voice or text prompt into fully autonomous action, even for completely novel tasks and objects NEO has never seen before. By leveraging internet-scale video data fine-tuned on real robot experience, NEO can visualize future actions, predict outcomes, and execute them with humanlike understanding–all without prior examples. This marks the critical first step in NEO being able to collect data on its own to master new tasks all by itself. [ 1X ] I’m impressed by the human who was mocapped for this. [ PNDbotics ] We introduce the GuideData Dataset, a collection of qualitative data, focusing on the interactions between guide dog trainers, visually impaired (BLV) individuals, and their guide dogs. The dataset captures a variety of real-world scenarios, including navigating sidewalks, climbing stairs, crossing streets, and avoiding obstacles. By providing this comprehensive dataset, the project aims to advance research in areas such as assistive technologies, robotics, and human-robot interaction, ultimately improving the mobility and safety of visually impaired people. [ DARoS Lab ] Fourier’s desktop Care-Bot prototype is gaining much attention at CES 2026! Even though it’s still in the prototype stage, we couldn’t wait to share these adorable and fun interaction features with you. [ Fourier ] Volcanic gas measurements are critical for understanding eruptive activity. However, harsh terrain, hazardous conditions, and logistical constraints make near-surface data collection extremely challenging. In this work, we present an autonomous legged robotic system for volcanic gas monitoring, validated through real-world deployments on Mount Etna. The system combines a quadruped robot equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a modular autonomy stack, enabling long-distance missions in rough volcanic terrain. [ ETH Zurich RSL ] Humanoid and Siemens successfully completed a POC testing humanoid robots in industrial logistics. This is the first step in the broader partnership between the companies. The POC focused on a tote-to-conveyor destacking task within Siemens’s logistics process. HMND 01 autonomously picked, transported, and placed totes in a live production environment during a two-week on-site deployment at the Siemens Electronics Factory in Erlangen. [ Humanoid ] Four Growers, a category leader in intelligent ag-tech platforms, developed the GR-200 robotic harvesting platform, powered by FANUC’s LR Mate robot. The system combines AI-driven vision and motion planning to identify and harvest ripe tomatoes with quick precision.

Weighing in at a surprisingly modest 1,003 pieces, the typically word salad-y Lego The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle is the second Lego Zelda set, following the 2,500-piece Great Deku Tree set in 2024. While the latter lets you choose between building either a Breath of the Wild or OoT-themed replica of the wise old guardian of the forest, the upcoming set is aimed squarely at fans of the series’ debut 3D outing. As you can probably guess from the name, it’s a brick-built tribute to Link and Princess Zelda’s climactic battle with Ganondorf in the seminal Nintendo 64 game, in what remains of the castle. Inside the rubble are three recovery hearts. It’s hard to see how this works without a video, but Lego says you can release Link’s nemesis by pressing a button that raises him from the debris. As well as the minifigures for Zelda and Link — complete with his Master Sword and Hylian Shield — you also get a suitably transparent Navi to display. And then there’s the large poseable Ganon (the pig demon version of Ganondorf), which is probably the highlight of the whole set. Interestingly, the new Ocarina of Time set is the first high-profile Lego announcement since unveiling its new Smart Brick at CES, but it looks like we’ll be playing with regular dumb Lego only here. You’ll just have to do the final Hyrule-saving \"Hyah!\" yourself, I guess. Lego The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle is available to pre-order from today and will be available from March 1, priced at $130.

Audible is having a sale right now that makes that easier and cheaper to do: you can get three months of access for only $1 per month, or a total of $3. The promotion runs through January 21. An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything. However, it's easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright. In other words, it's a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren't enjoying the platform.

An Audible subscription grants one audiobook per month to keep. This can be selected from a massive catalog of new releases and bestsellers. The collection here has just about everything. However, it's easy to plow through a single book in a month. Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright. In other words, it's a neat little service and well worth a buck. The regular price is $15, so make sure to cancel at the end of that three months if you aren't enjoying the platform. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.

Initially, the carrier posted on X that it will offer a $20 credit, but customers must redeem it in the myVerizon app. The company then said the credit could be claimed though customer service (via phone or chat), but our editors’ attempts to do so via chat were met with a message to wait for a text with further instructions. Engadget editors began receiving the texts this morning (Jan 16) with a link to redeem. From there, you need to log into your account and visit the Account Overview section. Up top, there should be a Take Action or Mobile Actions button with a red notification circle. Click that and you’ll see a pop-up about the credit and a Redeem Now button. After you click that, you’re done, and Verizon says you should see the credit in one or two billing cycles. Of course, you’ll want to keep an eye out that it actually happens and contact the company if it doesn’t show up. \"This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit really can,\" the company wrote. \"But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us.\" Incensed customers have largely replied with incredulity, both at the miniscule amount, and that it isn't being applied automatically. The entire redemption process takes a few clicks and about a minute to complete, which makes it even more frustrating that it can’t be automatically applied to every customer’s bill.

Once the rules are found and tested, the programmer can create a model of them in code which he, or she will execute to test that it works. This model is then handed to a graphic artist that can then take this model to drive graphics software to draw it on screen. Modern graphics processors, as you have seen, can create strikingly realistic, jaw-dropping images. Sure, the artist may be talented, but the real credit goes to the person who created the model. I am not trying to diminish the creativity, or imagination of the artist. In our case, the wizard behind the model of flocking behaviour was a young man named Craig Reynolds, who discovered a few simple rules in 1986. Look him up. Here are Reynold’s rules: Rule 1: Steer to avoid collisions. This is a repulsive force. It ensures that the birds do not collide. Each bird maintains a small protected zone around itself. If another bird enters this zone, then the bird steers in the opposite direction. Rule 2: Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates. The bird looks at the velocity (speed + direction) of its neighbours and tries to match it. This behaviour gives the flock its “flow” and prevents individuals from scattering in different directions. Rule 3: Steer to move toward the average position (centre of mass) of local flock mates. This makes the bird want to be in the middle of the group it can see. It prevents individuals from drifting off into isolation, ensuring the group remains a \"flock\" rather than a collection of independent actors. There is a subtle but vital detail in Reynold’s logic: Reynolds specified that individual birds don’t see the whole flock; they only see what is nearby. This is why a flock can split around buildings and other obstacles and rejoin as a group. If you are not a programmer, stop reading here. Programmers will probably want an example of how these simple rules are actually coded. Here is my implementation, written in pseudo-code, because I am language agnostic.

In an interview with The New York Times, Sarandos responded to a question about his company’s commitment to the theatrical business by insisting that he has no interest in bringing a swift end to it. \"We will run that business largely like it is today, with 45-day windows,\" he said. \"I’m giving you a hard number.

His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers. The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid. That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. \"When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,\" Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.\" Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale. Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: \"Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.\" The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, \"gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that.\" The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks. What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. \"In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,\" Wahlforss said. \"Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.\" The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called \"one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry\"—rampant fraud. \"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,\" he explained. \"We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.\" The company built what it calls a \"quality guard\" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: \"People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.\" Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. \"We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,\" said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus. How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. \"By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,\" said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft. With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours. The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. \"We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,\" Patel said, \"and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.\" Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks. Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. \"We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'\" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer. Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. \"There's school, sports, dinner, and homework,\" explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. \"I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.\" The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI \"through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.\" The redesigned product became \"a blockbuster hit.\" The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption. \"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,\" Wahlforss said. \"Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.\" But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption. \"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it,\" Wahlforss explained. \"There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job.\" Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. \"We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,\" Wahlforss recalled. \"We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.\" The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder \"was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.\" The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup. The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area. \"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,\" he said. \"But now we fixed that situation.\" The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere. Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building \"the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.\" Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. \"Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?\" Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. \"Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.\" The company already handles sensitive data with care. \"We don't train on any of the data,\" Wahlforss said. \"We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.\" How AI could reshape the future of product development Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop. \"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.\" The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — \"write code, talk to users\" — into an automated cycle. \"Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.\" Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos. \"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right,\" he said. But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has \"removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.\" Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day. \"It's a total game changer,\" said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager. Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website. One of them: \"Slow is fake.\" It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.","url":"https://venturebeat.com/technology/listen-labs-raises-usd69m-after-viral-billboard-hiring-stunt-to-scale-ai","imageUrl":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4gD12ThOmNHZuosqC4xCTz/277b1e8968da602108a29fae2eaca440/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_billboard_with_cryptic_code_dbe5b0ff-7644-45e6-a1ca-4a5dceeff986.webp?w=300&q=30","publishedAt":"2026-01-16T14:01:00.000Z","sourceName":"VentureBeat","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers. The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid. That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. \"When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,\" Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.\" Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale. Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: \"Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.\" The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, \"gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that.\" The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks. What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. \"In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,\" Wahlforss said. \"Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.\" The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called \"one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry\"—rampant fraud. \"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,\" he explained. \"We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.\" The company built what it calls a \"quality guard\" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: \"People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.\" Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. \"We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,\" said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus. How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. \"By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,\" said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft. With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours. The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. \"We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,\" Patel said, \"and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.\" Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.

The product, called Kilo for Slack, arrives as the AI-assisted coding market heats up with multibillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds. But rather than building another siloed coding assistant, Kilo is making a calculated bet: that the future of AI development tools lies not in locking engineers into a single interface, but in embedding AI capabilities into the fragmented workflows where decisions actually happen. \"Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,\" Scott Breitenother, Kilo Code's co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The Slackbot allows you to do all this — and more — without leaving Slack.\" The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax's M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models. How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chat The integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor. With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request. A typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \"@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\" The bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack. The company says the entire process eliminates the need to copy information between apps or jump between windows — developers can trigger complex code changes with nothing more than a single message in Slack. Why Kilo says Cursor and Claude Code fall short when developers need multi-repo context Kilo's launch explicitly positions the product against two leading AI coding tools: Cursor, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November, and Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Breitenother outlined specific limitations he sees in both products' Slack capabilities. \"The Cursor Slack integration is configured on a single-repository basis per workspace or channel,\" he said. \"As a result, if a Slack thread references multiple repositories, users need to manually switch or reconfigure the integration to pull in that additional context.\" On Anthropic's offering, he added: \"Claude Code documentation for Slack shows how Claude can be added to a workspace and respond to mentions using the surrounding conversation context. However, it does not describe persistent, multi-turn thread state or task-level continuity across longer workflows. Each interaction is handled based on the context included at the time of the prompt, rather than maintaining an evolving execution state over time.\" Kilo claims its integration works across multiple repositories simultaneously, maintains conversational context across extended Slack threads, and enables handoffs between Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, and the command-line interface. Kilo picks a Chinese AI company's model as its default—and addresses enterprise security concerns head-on Perhaps the most provocative element of the announcement is Kilo's choice of default model. MiniMax is headquartered in Shanghai and recently went public in Hong Kong — a lineage that may raise eyebrows among enterprise customers wary of sending proprietary code through Chinese infrastructure. Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \"MiniMax's recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\" He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year's re:Invent keynote, showing they're ready for enterprise use at scale.\" The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn't force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they're hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\" The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo's broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\" In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\" What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in Slack For engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration. Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it's mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack's standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\" For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can't see anything the user or workspace hasn't authorized.\" The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions. A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production? \"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\" He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\" The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won't kill the business Kilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product. The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version? \"Forking the code isn't what worries us, because the code itself isn't the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn't get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we've built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\" He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren't paying for access to code. They're paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\" Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disrupt Kilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft's codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor's November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion. Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy. Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab's own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\" Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That's not something we can disclose.\" How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI coding The most significant threat to Kilo's position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources. Breitenother argued that Kilo's advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance. \"We don't think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they'll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn't generating code, it's integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\" He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate: \"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\" \"Model flexibility: We're model-agnostic by design. Teams don't have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That's difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\" \"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn't trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\" The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem first Kilo's launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built. That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers. Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones. Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo's integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added.

The product, called Kilo for Slack, arrives as the AI-assisted coding market heats up with multibillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds. But rather than building another siloed coding assistant, Kilo is making a calculated bet: that the future of AI development tools lies not in locking engineers into a single interface, but in embedding AI capabilities into the fragmented workflows where decisions actually happen. \"Engineering teams don't make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,\" Scott Breitenother, Kilo Code's co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The Slackbot allows you to do all this — and more — without leaving Slack.\" The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax's M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models. How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chat The integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor. With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request. A typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \"@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\" The bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack. The company says the entire process eliminates the need to copy information between apps or jump between windows — developers can trigger complex code changes with nothing more than a single message in Slack. Why Kilo says Cursor and Claude Code fall short when developers need multi-repo context Kilo's launch explicitly positions the product against two leading AI coding tools: Cursor, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November, and Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Breitenother outlined specific limitations he sees in both products' Slack capabilities. \"The Cursor Slack integration is configured on a single-repository basis per workspace or channel,\" he said. \"As a result, if a Slack thread references multiple repositories, users need to manually switch or reconfigure the integration to pull in that additional context.\" On Anthropic's offering, he added: \"Claude Code documentation for Slack shows how Claude can be added to a workspace and respond to mentions using the surrounding conversation context. However, it does not describe persistent, multi-turn thread state or task-level continuity across longer workflows. Each interaction is handled based on the context included at the time of the prompt, rather than maintaining an evolving execution state over time.\" Kilo claims its integration works across multiple repositories simultaneously, maintains conversational context across extended Slack threads, and enables handoffs between Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, and the command-line interface. Kilo picks a Chinese AI company's model as its default—and addresses enterprise security concerns head-on Perhaps the most provocative element of the announcement is Kilo's choice of default model. MiniMax is headquartered in Shanghai and recently went public in Hong Kong — a lineage that may raise eyebrows among enterprise customers wary of sending proprietary code through Chinese infrastructure. Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \"MiniMax's recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\" He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year's re:Invent keynote, showing they're ready for enterprise use at scale.\" The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn't force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they're hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\" The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo's broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\" In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\" What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in Slack For engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration. Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it's mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack's standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\" For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can't see anything the user or workspace hasn't authorized.\" The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions. A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production? \"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\" He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\" The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won't kill the business Kilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product. The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version? \"Forking the code isn't what worries us, because the code itself isn't the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn't get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we've built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\" He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren't paying for access to code. They're paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\" Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disrupt Kilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft's codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor's November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion. Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy. Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab's own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\" Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That's not something we can disclose.\" How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI coding The most significant threat to Kilo's position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources. Breitenother argued that Kilo's advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance. \"We don't think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they'll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn't generating code, it's integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\" He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate: \"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\" \"Model flexibility: We're model-agnostic by design. Teams don't have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That's difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\" \"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn't trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\" The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem first Kilo's launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built. That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers. Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones. Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo's integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added. Usage-based pricing matches the rates of whatever model the team selects. Whether a 34-person startup can execute on that vision against competitors with billions in capital remains an open question. But if Breitenother is right that the hard problem in AI coding isn't generating code but integrating into workflows, Kilo may have picked the right fight. After all, the best AI in the world doesn't matter much if developers have to leave the conversation to use it.","tags":[]},{"id":"206978188b079e78777ded17","title":"Meta is closing down its VR meeting rooms as part of its wider cull","summary":"Meta is killing the standalone Workrooms app on February 16, 2026.

Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.

Instead of laboring over a spreadsheet, you can try one of our favorite budgeting apps for less than usual. Monarch Money is running a sale that gives new users 50 percent off one year of the service, bringing the final cost down to just $50. Just use the code NEWYEAR2026 at checkout to get the discount. Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you're tracking that month. How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you've labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together. The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app's learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch's web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you're trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.

In the coming weeks, the platform will roll out upgraded age-detection tech in the European Economic Area, as well as in the UK and Switzerland. The systems will assess the likely age of a user based on their profile information and activity. When the tech flags an account that may belong to a user aged under 13 (the minimum age to use TikTok), a specialist moderator will assess whether it should be banned. TikTok will send users in Europe a notification to tell them about these measures and offer them a chance to learn more. Also, if a moderator is looking at content for other reasons and thinks an account might belong to an underage user, they can flag it to a specialist for further review. Anyone can report an account they suspect is used by someone under 13 as well. TikTok says it removes about 6 million underage accounts in total from the platform every month. Those whose accounts are banned can appeal if they think their access was wrongly terminated. Users can then provide a government-approved ID, a credit card authorization or selfie for age estimation (the latter process has not gone well for Roblox as of late, as kids found workarounds for age checks). TikTok acknowledged that there's no single ideal solution to the issue as things stand. \"Despite best efforts, there remains no globally agreed-upon method for effectively confirming a person's age in a way that also preserves their privacy,\" it stated in a blog post. \"At TikTok, we're committed to keeping children under the age of 13 off our platform, providing teens with age-appropriate experiences and continuing to assess and implement a range of solutions. We believe that a multi-layered approach to age assurance — one in which multiple techniques are used — is essential to protecting teens and upholding safety-by-design principles.\" TikTok is rolling out these practices after a pilot in Europe over the last year. That project helped the platform to identify and remove thousands more underage accounts. It worked with the Data Protection Commission (its main privacy regulator in the EU) to help ensure it complied with the bloc’s strict data protection standards. These measures are coming into force amid intensifying calls to keep kids off social media. A social media ban for under 16s in Australia went into effect last month. Affected platforms have collectively closed or restricted millions of accounts as a result. Reddit has filed a lawsuit over the ban. A similar ban might be on the cards in the UK amid public pressure and cross-party support. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said \"all options are on the table\" and that he was watching \"what is happening in Australia.\" The House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for an under-16 social media ban next week. If an amendment passes, members of parliament will hold a binding vote on the matter in the coming months.

In 2026, features once exclusive to high-end smartphones – big batteries, multi-camera arrays, high refresh rate OLED displays and more – have made their way down to more affordable models. Yes, you’ll still need to buy a flagship smartphone to get the best camera or fastest processor, but you don't have to make nearly as many compromises as you once did if you have a strict budget to adhere to when you go shopping for your next smartphone. If you have less than $600 to spend, let us help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone. Table of contents Best midrange phones in 2026 What is a midrange phone? What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone What won't you get from a midrange phone Best midrange phones for 2026 What is a midrange phone? While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the Apple iPhone 17 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 if you want the best smartphone experience. Devices like Pixel phones often sit in this price range too, offering some of the best value for Android buyers. What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out. Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer with software updates and security updates, so it’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford. Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras with high megapixel counts? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier. What won’t you get from a midrange smartphone? Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and functions trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2026, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true. One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their camera systems have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600 with decent camera quality, selfie performance and software support to keep things running smoothly for years to come.. Midrange smartphone FAQs How long do midrange phones get software updates? Support varies by brand, but most midrange phones receive around three to five years of software and security updates. Apple tends to support iPhones longer while companies like Google and Samsung now promise several years of Android and security patches for their midrange models. Budget-focused brands might offer less so it’s worth checking the update policy before you buy. Are midrange phones good for gaming? Yes, many midrange phones handle gaming well, especially popular titles like Fortnite, Genshin Impact and Call of Duty Mobile. They usually include capable processors, though you won’t always get the smoothest performance in the most demanding mobile games or at max settings. If you play casually or stick to less graphically intensive titles a midrange phone will feel more than adequate. Georgie Peru contributed to this report.

My concern is that blindly applying standard weight decay (L2 on parameters) may be actively harmful in this setting. In RealNVP, each coupling layer is explicitly structured so that small weights push the transformation toward the identity map. With weight decay, we’re therefore not just regularizing capacity, we are actually biasing the model towards doing nothing. In flows, the identity transform is a perfectly valid (and often high-likelihood early) solution (especially if you zero init your scale networks which seems to be standard practice), so weight decay feels like it’s reinforcing a bad inductive bias. Most implementations seem to include weight decay by default, but I haven’t seen much discussion about whether it actually makes sense for invertible models. EDIT: Following this post, I took the liberty of exploring this question through a toy problem. The setup is intentionally simple: I train a RealNVP-style flow to map between a standard Gaussian and a learned latent distribution coming from another model I’m working on.

My concern is that blindly applying standard weight decay (L2 on parameters) may be actively harmful in this setting. In RealNVP, each coupling layer is explicitly structured so that small weights push the transformation toward the identity map. With weight decay, we’re therefore not just regularizing capacity, we are actually biasing the model towards doing nothing. In flows, the identity transform is a perfectly valid (and often high-likelihood early) solution (especially if you zero init your scale networks which seems to be standard practice), so weight decay feels like it’s reinforcing a bad inductive bias. Most implementations seem to include weight decay by default, but I haven’t seen much discussion about whether it actually makes sense for invertible models. EDIT: Following this post, I took the liberty of exploring this question through a toy problem. The setup is intentionally simple: I train a RealNVP-style flow to map between a standard Gaussian and a learned latent distribution coming from another model I’m working on. The target latent distribution has very small variance (overall std ≈ 0.067, with some dimensions down at 1e-4), which makes the identity-map bias especially relevant.

First multimodal model trained completely on Chinese chips (Huawei Ascend 910) from data preprocessing to full scale training. They're using a hybrid architecture combining autoregressive + diffusion decoder. What stands out is the Chinese text rendering. It consistently ranks first among open source models for complex text generation, especially handling Chinese characters which most models struggle with. Native support for 1024 to 2048 resolution at any aspect ratio without additional training. API pricing is 0.1 yuan per image (roughly $0.014). The model handles both text to image and image to image generation in a single model. GitHub and Hugging Face repos are already up. This is significant because it proves you can train frontier models without relying on Nvidia hardware. The compute efficiency numbers they're claiming are 60% better than H200 for tokens per joule.

Although she will continue as a producer for several Star Wars projects, including upcoming movie The Mandalorian and Grogu, the company will now be helmed by a duo in Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan. It's a big changing of the guard for Star Wars fans, and marks the start of a fresh chapter for the sci-fi universe. Before taking over at Lucasfilm, Kennedy had seen great success as a producer with a couple little films you may have heard of: E.T. and Jurassic Park. She became Lucasfilm's president in 2012 when the company was acquired by Disney. At that point, it had been several years since the last Star Wars movie; Revenge of the Sith closed out the generally panned prequel trilogy in 2005. Fans' best option for Star Wars content was The Clone Wars, a standalone film and animated series which were well-regarded but primarily popular among the hardcore devotees rather than reaching the widespread cultural relevance of the prior feature films. During Kennedy's tenure, Star Wars returned to the big screen with The Force Awakens in 2015. Although that J.J. Abrams-led trilogy was also a roller coaster for many fans, it marked a renaissance for the franchise. Lucasfilm embarked on two standalone movies in Rogue One and Solo, which generated yet more buzz and more money for the company. Star Wars got the full cinematic universe treatment, with critically acclaimed live-action television projects and several new video games. The world fell in love with Baby Yoda. Ewan McGregor finally got to don his Obi-Wan Kenobi robe in a better vehicle. The franchise was back in the mainstream, with the budgets and expectations of media behemoth Disney at its back. No matter your feelings on the current state of Star Wars, it's an impressive accomplishment by Kennedy and a big legacy that she leaves behind at Lucasfilm. So now that Lucasfilm has arguably ended this phase on a high note, what's next? Dave Filoni moving into the top spot isn't much of a surprise. He's long been seen by fans and seemingly by the company as George Lucas' spiritual successor. Filoni was also the showrunner on The Clone Wars back in the day and has been involved in some capacity with many of the recent TV series, most notably The Mandalorian and Ahsoka. All that history means his new role of President and Chief Creative Officer is pretty expected, and the Star Wars faithful likely feel that they are in good hands. As the title implies, Filoni will be responsible for the artistic side of the operation, while as Co-President, Lynwen Brennan will be in charge of the business side. Brennan may be a less familiar name, but her tenure with Lucas' businesses dates back to 1999 when she joined the legendary effects studio Industrial Light & Magic. Dividing the art and the commerce can yield good results if the two are able to find a good synergy. Star Wars has proven that it's a moneymaker even when the films and series aren't particularly well-received, but here's hoping that Filoni and Brennan will each be able to maintain high standards for Lucasfilm and the Star Wars fandom.

In its most recent video, the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it. Hardware Unboxed also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year. The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well,\" with ASUS stating it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to manufacture in the current economic climate. And while there might be some hope of the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB returning later this year, the channel suggests both are unlikely to make a comeback. “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget. ASUS did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. After uploading its video, Hardware Unboxed published a clarification. “ASUS did not tell us that NVIDIA said the RTX 5070 Ti has been discontinued. ASUS told us there is very little supply of the 5070 Ti, so their own 5070 Ti products (e.g, the Prime and TUF Gaming) have been put into end of life status,” the channel said. “With retailers also unable to source 5070 Ti SKUs from any AIB, this effectively makes it a dead product.” The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer RAM kits, GPUs and SSDs. In December, Micron Technology announced it would wind down its consumer-facing Crucial brand to focus exclusively on providing components to the AI industry. ASUS is the first of NVIDIA’s add-in board (AIB) partners to comment on the memory crunch. AIBs are the companies that produce the majority of GPUs you can buy from NVIDIA and AMD. Historically, NVIDIA has provided its board partners with both the die and memory needed to make a graphics cards. However, a recent rumor suggested the company had told it partners they would need to start sourcing memory on their own. Update 12:55PM ET: Added more context.

On Thursday, the Senate passed an appropriations bill funding NASA, alongside the National Science Foundation and a handful of other federal agencies. Going into the appropriations process, the president called for a 24 percent year over year reduction to NASA's total operating budget. As part of that plan, the White House wanted to reduce the Science Mission Directorate's funding by nearly half, a move that would have forced NASA to cancel 55 ongoing and planned missions, including efforts like OSIRIS-APEX. The bill effectively rejects President Trump's plan, reducing NASA's total operating budget by just 1.6 percent year over year to $24.4 billion. Per the new appropriations, NASA's science budget will stand at $7.25 billion, 1.1 percent less relative to fiscal 2024, while shuffling the remaining funds to focus on different priorities. For instance, the House and Senate allocated $874 million (+8.7 percent) for the agency's heliophysics work; planetary sciences, which oversees missions like New Horizons, was cut to $2.5 billion (-6.5 percent) compared to 2024. At the same time, NASA's STEM engagement office, which the president proposed eliminating, escaped unscathed with its funding maintained at parity. \"It's almost everything we had been asking for, and it's very encouraging to see a House and Senate run by the president's own party agreeing that we need to keep investing in things like NASA science,\" says Casey Dreier, chief of policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit founded by Carl Sagan that advocates for the exploration and study of space. \"It contains very clear and direct language that not only is this funding made available to these projects, but that it will be spent on the initiatives that Congress states.\" Lawmakers also rejected Trump's effort to scuttle the Space Launch System after its third flight. NASA's heavy-lift rocket is billions of dollars over budget, but remains — as of now — the only spacecraft ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. Compared to the rest of NASA, the fate of the SLS was never really in doubt. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured funding for the rocket as part of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. \"I've been saying for a long time you should never underestimate the political coalition behind the SLS, and I think that was very much validated this year,\" says Dreier. More importantly, it appears the Goddard Space Flight Center will be safe from further damage. Over the summer, the future of the facility, known for its work on projects like the James Webb Space Telescope, was put in jeopardy. By some estimates, the campus has lost a third of its staff due to workforce cuts, and dozens of buildings, including some 100 laboratories, have been shut down by management. One of the casualties was NASA's largest library, which houses irreplaceable documents chronicling the history of the space race. As part of a \"consolidation\" effort, many of those documents will be thrown out. Under the appropriations bill, the Senate has directed NASA to “preserve all the technical and scientific world-class capabilities at Goddard.” It has also instructed the agency to ensure employees of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are able to continue their work with \"minimal disruption.\" The New York-based office, one of America's leading climate labs, was sent into limbo last spring after the Trump administration moved to shut it down. The bill also provides a lifeline for NASA's to bring back samples of Martian dirt collected by the Perseverance rover. Congress has effectively cancelled the official program tied to that ambition, the Mars Sample Return (MSR), but has set aside $110 million for the agency to continue developing technologies for future science missions to the Red Planet. MSR advocates have argued the mission could lead to significant scientific discoveries, but Dreier notes the program was \"ripe for cancellation\" after it became mired in mismanagement. \"I worry MSR now has this stink of bloat, excess cost and threat of overruns that are really going to make it challenging to restart this without having a dramatically different approach,\" says Dreier, adding that deciding what to do with mission will likely be top of mind for the agency's new administrator, Jared Isaacman. The 2026 budget leaves NASA with fewer resources. Even in areas where Congress allocated the same amount of funds as it did in 2024, the agency will need to do more with less due to inflation. Compared to the absolute blood bath that would have been Trump's proposed budget, a marginal funding cut is the best case scenario given the circumstances, but the circumstances remain less than ideal. \"There will be another presidential budget request coming out in the next couple of months,\" Dreier said. \"They could do this all over again if they wanted to.\" In the immediate future, NASA and its employees are at least protected from the potential fallout of another impending government shutdown. Congress has until January 30 to fully fund the federal government, and as of earlier this week, it has yet to find a way forward on appropriations for agencies like the Department of Labor.

The US Department of Commerce announced that Taiwanese businesses will make an upfront investment of at least $250 billion into their US production capacity, while Taiwan's government will provide credit guarantees of at least another $250 billion in support of the semiconductor industry and supply chain in the US. In exchange, Taiwan will receive a better deal on tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs will be limited to 15 percent, compared with the previous 20 percent rate. Generic pharmaceuticals and their generic ingredients, aircraft components, and unavailable natural resources will be not be subjected to reciprocal tariffs under the arrangement. Taiwanese companies with US production will also see increased import amounts without being charged duties under the Section 232 framework. According to reports from CNBC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSNC) is already in position to take advantage of the new trade agreement with further expansion in Arizona. The major Taiwanese chip manufacturer had previously committed to investing $100 billion in its US operations over four years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC in an interview that the current US government wants to bring 40 percent of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain stateside, continuing to use tariffs as an incentive. \"If they don’t build in America, the tariff’s likely to be 100 percent,” Lutnick said.

Live Now is included as part of Bluesky's v1.114 update, alongside \"cashtags,\" a separate type of hashtag for collecting conversations about publicly-traded companies. Bluesky first started testing its Live Now badge in May 2025 with a limited group of accounts, including the official NBA account. The feature lets Twitch streamers with Bluesky profiles append a Live Now badge to their profile picture that links directly to their livestream. Live Now badges are limited to Twitch links for now, but Bluesky says \"support for other streaming platforms may follow\" as it learns from the beta. Linking to other social platforms shouldn't be a radical concept, but since Bluesky's competitor X has tried to prevent users from posting links in the past, the company has made it a point of trying to do the opposite. Cashtags are a similar attempt to appeal to a certain type of veteran X user. Originally a feature of pre-Musk Twitter, cashtags work like a hashtag, marking posts in a way that makes them easy to find in a search or by tapping the cashtag itself. On Bluesky, by typing a dollar sign ($) and the stock abbreviation of a company (AAPL for Apple, for example), you can add a cashtag to your post that links it to other posts using the same cashtag. So far, the cultural makeup of Bluesky hasn't seemed as business-oriented as X, but the feature suggests Bluesky wants the option to be available for anyone who jumps ship.

On Bluesky, by typing a dollar sign ($) and the stock abbreviation of a company (AAPL for Apple, for example), you can add a cashtag to your post that links it to other posts using the same cashtag. So far, the cultural makeup of Bluesky hasn't seemed as business-oriented as X, but the feature suggests Bluesky wants the option to be available for anyone who jumps ship.

On Thursday, Wired reported on a security flaw in 17 headphone and speaker models that could allow hackers to access your devices, including their microphones. The vulnerability stems from a faulty implementation of Google's one-tap (Fast Pair) protocol. Security researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group, who discovered the security hole, named the flaw WhisperPair. They say a hacker within Bluetooth range would only require the accessory's (easily attainable) device model number and a few seconds. \"You're walking down the street with your headphones on, you're listening to some music. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,\" KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta told Wired. \"Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. I can inject audio. I can track your location.\" The researchers notified Google about WhisperPair in August, and the company has been working with them since then. Fast Pair is supposed to only allow new connections while the audio device is in pairing mode. (A proper implementation of this would have prevented this flaw.) But a Google spokesperson told Engadget that the vulnerability stemmed from an improper implementation of Fast Pair by some of its hardware partners. This could then allow a hacker's device to pair with your headphones or speaker after it's already paired with your device. \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe,\" a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to Engadget. \"We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\" The researchers created the video below to demonstrate how the flaw works In an email to Engadget, Google said the steps required to access the device’s microphone or audio are complex and involve multiple stages. The attackers would also need to remain within Bluetooth range. The company added that it provided its OEM partners with recommended fixes in September. Google also updated its Validator certification tool and its certification requirements. The researchers say that, in some cases, the risk applies even to those who don't use Android phones. For example, if the audio accessory has never been paired with a Google account, a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the audio device but also link it to their own Google account. They could then use Google's Find Hub tool to track the device's (and therefore your) location. Google said it rolled out a fix to its Find Hub network to address that particular scenario. However, the researchers told Wired that, within hours of the patch’s rollout, they found a workaround. The 17 affected devices are made by 10 different companies, all of which received Google Fast Pair certification. They include Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. (Google says its affected Pixel Buds are already patched and protected.) The researchers posted a search tool that lets you see if your audio accessories are vulnerable. In a statement sent to Engadget, OnePlus said it's investigating the issue and \"will take appropriate action to protect our users' security and privacy.\" Marshall said it patched the issue in November and is working with Google to avoid similar issues in the future (see full statement below). We also contacted the other accessory makers and will update this story if we hear back. The researchers recommend updating your audio devices regularly. However, one of their concerns is that many people will never install the third-party manufacturer's app (required for updates), leaving their devices vulnerable. The full report from Wired has much more detail and is worth a read. Update, January 15 2026, 4:04PM ET: “We can confirm that Marshall has issued the necessary firmware updates and security patches to address the headphones potentially affected,” a company representative told Engadget. “These updates have been available since November and have been offered to all users since then.

It is the engine behind Anthropic's hit AI agentic programming harness, Claude Code, allowing it to access numerous functions like web browsing and file creation immediately when asked. But there was one problem: Claude Code typically had to \"read\" the instruction manual for every single tool available, regardless of whether it was needed for the immediate task, using up the available context that could otherwise be filled with more information from the user's prompts or the agent's responses. At least until last night. The Claude Code team released an update that fundamentally alters this equation. Dubbed MCP Tool Search, the feature introduces \"lazy loading\" for AI tools, allowing agents to dynamically fetch tool definitions only when necessary. It is a shift that moves AI agents from a brute-force architecture to something resembling modern software engineering—and according to early data, it effectively solves the \"bloat\" problem that was threatening to stifle the ecosystem. The 'Startup Tax' on Agents To understand the significance of Tool Search, one must understand the friction of the previous system. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in 2024 by Anthropic as an open source standard was designed to be a universal standard for connecting AI models to data sources and tools—everything from GitHub repositories to local file systems. However, as the ecosystem grew, so did the \"startup tax.\" Thariq Shihipar, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, highlighted the scale of the problem in the announcement. \"We've found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools,\" Shihipar wrote. \"Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.\" In practical terms, this meant a developer using a robust set of tools might sacrifice 33% or more of their available context window limit of 200,000 tokens before they even typed a single character of a prompt, as AI newsletter author Aakash Gupta pointed out in a post on X. The model was effectively \"reading\" hundreds of pages of technical documentation for tools it might never use during that session. Community analysis provided even starker examples. Gupta further noted that a single Docker MCP server could consume 125,000 tokens just to define its 135 tools. \"The old constraint forced a brutal tradeoff,\" he wrote. \"Either limit your MCP servers to 2-3 core tools, or accept that half your context budget disappears before you start working.\" How Tool Search Works The solution Anthropic rolled out — which Shihipar called \"one of our most-requested features on GitHub\" — is elegant in its restraint. Instead of preloading every definition, Claude Code now monitors context usage. According to the release notes, the system automatically detects when tool descriptions would consume more than 10% of the available context. When that threshold is crossed, the system switches strategies. Instead of dumping raw documentation into the prompt, it loads a lightweight search index. When the user asks for a specific action—say, \"deploy this container\"—Claude Code doesn't scan a massive, pre-loaded list of 200 commands. Instead, it queries the index, finds the relevant tool definition, and pulls only that specific tool into the context. \"Tool Search flips the architecture,\" Gupta analyzed. \"The token savings are dramatic: from ~134k to ~5k in Anthropic’s internal testing. That’s an 85% reduction while maintaining full tool access.\" For developers maintaining MCP servers, this shifts the optimization strategy. Shihipar noted that the `server instructions` field in the MCP definition—previously a \"nice to have\"—is now critical. It acts as the metadata that helps Claude \"know when to search for your tools, similar to skills.\" 'Lazy Loading' and Accuracy Gains While the token savings are the headline metric—saving money and memory is always popular—the secondary effect of this update might be more important: focus. LLMs are notoriously sensitive to \"distraction.\" When a model's context window is stuffed with thousands of lines of irrelevant tool definitions, its ability to reason decreases. It creates a \"needle in a haystack\" problem where the model struggles to differentiate between similar commands, such as `notification-send-user` versus `notification-send-channel`. Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code, emphasized this in his reaction to the launch on X: \"Every Claude Code user just got way more context, better instruction following, and the ability to plug in even more tools.\" The data backs this up. Internal benchmarks shared by the community indicate that enabling Tool Search improved the accuracy of the Opus 4 model on MCP evaluations from 49% to 74%. For the newer Opus 4.5, accuracy jumped from 79.5% to 88.1%. By removing the noise of hundreds of unused tools, the model can dedicate its \"attention\" mechanisms to the user's actual query and the relevant active tools. Maturing the Stack This update signals a maturation in how we treat AI infrastructure. In the early days of any software paradigm, brute force is common. But as systems scale, efficiency becomes the primary engineering challenge. Aakash Gupta drew a parallel to the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VSCode or JetBrains. \"The bottleneck wasn’t 'too many tools.' It was loading tool definitions like 2020-era static imports instead of 2024-era lazy loading,\" he wrote. \"VSCode doesn’t load every extension at startup. JetBrains doesn’t inject every plugin’s docs into memory.\" By adopting \"lazy loading\"—a standard best practice in web and software development—Anthropic is acknowledging that AI agents are no longer just novelties; they are complex software platforms that require architectural discipline. Implications for the Ecosystem For the end user, this update is seamless: Claude Code simply feels \"smarter\" and retains more memory of the conversation. But for the developer ecosystem, it opens the floodgates. Previously, there was a \"soft cap\" on how capable an agent could be. Developers had to curate their toolsets carefully to avoid lobotomizing the model with excessive context. With Tool Search, that ceiling is effectively removed. An agent can theoretically have access to thousands of tools—database connectors, cloud deployment scripts, API wrappers, local file manipulators—without paying a penalty until those tools are actually touched. It turns the \"context economy\" from a scarcity model into an access model. As Gupta summarized, \"They’re not just optimizing context usage.

It is the engine behind Anthropic's hit AI agentic programming harness, Claude Code, allowing it to access numerous functions like web browsing and file creation immediately when asked. But there was one problem: Claude Code typically had to \"read\" the instruction manual for every single tool available, regardless of whether it was needed for the immediate task, using up the available context that could otherwise be filled with more information from the user's prompts or the agent's responses. At least until last night. The Claude Code team released an update that fundamentally alters this equation. Dubbed MCP Tool Search, the feature introduces \"lazy loading\" for AI tools, allowing agents to dynamically fetch tool definitions only when necessary. It is a shift that moves AI agents from a brute-force architecture to something resembling modern software engineering—and according to early data, it effectively solves the \"bloat\" problem that was threatening to stifle the ecosystem. The 'Startup Tax' on Agents To understand the significance of Tool Search, one must understand the friction of the previous system. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in 2024 by Anthropic as an open source standard was designed to be a universal standard for connecting AI models to data sources and tools—everything from GitHub repositories to local file systems. However, as the ecosystem grew, so did the \"startup tax.\" Thariq Shihipar, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, highlighted the scale of the problem in the announcement. \"We've found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools,\" Shihipar wrote. \"Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.\" In practical terms, this meant a developer using a robust set of tools might sacrifice 33% or more of their available context window limit of 200,000 tokens before they even typed a single character of a prompt, as AI newsletter author Aakash Gupta pointed out in a post on X. The model was effectively \"reading\" hundreds of pages of technical documentation for tools it might never use during that session. Community analysis provided even starker examples. Gupta further noted that a single Docker MCP server could consume 125,000 tokens just to define its 135 tools. \"The old constraint forced a brutal tradeoff,\" he wrote. \"Either limit your MCP servers to 2-3 core tools, or accept that half your context budget disappears before you start working.\" How Tool Search Works The solution Anthropic rolled out — which Shihipar called \"one of our most-requested features on GitHub\" — is elegant in its restraint. Instead of preloading every definition, Claude Code now monitors context usage. According to the release notes, the system automatically detects when tool descriptions would consume more than 10% of the available context. When that threshold is crossed, the system switches strategies. Instead of dumping raw documentation into the prompt, it loads a lightweight search index. When the user asks for a specific action—say, \"deploy this container\"—Claude Code doesn't scan a massive, pre-loaded list of 200 commands. Instead, it queries the index, finds the relevant tool definition, and pulls only that specific tool into the context. \"Tool Search flips the architecture,\" Gupta analyzed. \"The token savings are dramatic: from ~134k to ~5k in Anthropic’s internal testing. That’s an 85% reduction while maintaining full tool access.\" For developers maintaining MCP servers, this shifts the optimization strategy. Shihipar noted that the `server instructions` field in the MCP definition—previously a \"nice to have\"—is now critical. It acts as the metadata that helps Claude \"know when to search for your tools, similar to skills.\" 'Lazy Loading' and Accuracy Gains While the token savings are the headline metric—saving money and memory is always popular—the secondary effect of this update might be more important: focus. LLMs are notoriously sensitive to \"distraction.\" When a model's context window is stuffed with thousands of lines of irrelevant tool definitions, its ability to reason decreases. It creates a \"needle in a haystack\" problem where the model struggles to differentiate between similar commands, such as `notification-send-user` versus `notification-send-channel`. Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code, emphasized this in his reaction to the launch on X: \"Every Claude Code user just got way more context, better instruction following, and the ability to plug in even more tools.\" The data backs this up. Internal benchmarks shared by the community indicate that enabling Tool Search improved the accuracy of the Opus 4 model on MCP evaluations from 49% to 74%. For the newer Opus 4.5, accuracy jumped from 79.5% to 88.1%. By removing the noise of hundreds of unused tools, the model can dedicate its \"attention\" mechanisms to the user's actual query and the relevant active tools. Maturing the Stack This update signals a maturation in how we treat AI infrastructure. In the early days of any software paradigm, brute force is common. But as systems scale, efficiency becomes the primary engineering challenge. Aakash Gupta drew a parallel to the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VSCode or JetBrains. \"The bottleneck wasn’t 'too many tools.' It was loading tool definitions like 2020-era static imports instead of 2024-era lazy loading,\" he wrote. \"VSCode doesn’t load every extension at startup. JetBrains doesn’t inject every plugin’s docs into memory.\" By adopting \"lazy loading\"—a standard best practice in web and software development—Anthropic is acknowledging that AI agents are no longer just novelties; they are complex software platforms that require architectural discipline. Implications for the Ecosystem For the end user, this update is seamless: Claude Code simply feels \"smarter\" and retains more memory of the conversation. But for the developer ecosystem, it opens the floodgates. Previously, there was a \"soft cap\" on how capable an agent could be. Developers had to curate their toolsets carefully to avoid lobotomizing the model with excessive context. With Tool Search, that ceiling is effectively removed. An agent can theoretically have access to thousands of tools—database connectors, cloud deployment scripts, API wrappers, local file manipulators—without paying a penalty until those tools are actually touched. It turns the \"context economy\" from a scarcity model into an access model. As Gupta summarized, \"They’re not just optimizing context usage. They’re changing what ‘tool-rich agents’ can mean.\" The update is rolling out immediately for Claude Code users. For developers building MCP clients, Anthropic recommends implementing the `ToolSearchTool` to support this dynamic loading, ensuring that as the agentic future arrives, it doesn't run out of memory before it even says hello.","tags":[]},{"id":"0a7d882a9099632e87b2ca5f","title":"AWS CodeBuild Misconfiguration Exposed GitHub Repos to Potential Supply Chain Attacks","summary":"A critical misconfiguration in Amazon Web Services (AWS) CodeBuild could have allowed complete takeover of the cloud service provider's own GitHub repositories, including its AWS JavaScript SDK, putting every AWS environment at risk.

Instead, it depends on cultivating a balanced mix of technical fundamentals and human-centered skills—capabilities that machines are unlikely to replace. AI is reshaping the job market faster than most academic programs and employers can keep up with, according to the guide. AI systems now can analyze cybercrime, predict equipment failures in manufacturing, and generate text, code, and images at scale, leading to mass layoffs across much of the technology sector. It has unsettled recent graduates about to enter the job market as well as early-career professionals. Yet the demand for AI expertise remains strong in the banking, health care, retail, and pharmaceutical industries, whose businesses are racing to deploy generative AI tools to improve productivity and decision-making—and keep up with the competition. The uneven landscape leaves many observers confused about how best to prepare for a career in a field that is redefining itself. Addressing that uncertainty is the focus of the guide, which was written by San Murugesan and Rodica Neamtu. Murugesan, an IEEE life senior member, is an adjunct professor at Western Sydney University, in Penrith, Australia. Neamtu, an IEEE member, is a professor of teaching and a data-mining researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts. The downloadable 24-page PDF outlines what aspiring AI professionals should focus on, which skills are most likely to remain valuable amid rapid automation, and why AI careers are increasingly less about building algorithms in isolation and more about applying them thoughtfully across domains. The guide emphasizes adaptability as the defining requirement for entering the field, rather than fluency in any particular programming language or framework. Why AI careers are being redefined AI systems perform tasks that once required human intelligence. What distinguishes the current situation from when AI was introduced, the authors say, is not just improved performance but also expanded scope. Pattern recognition, reasoning, optimization, and machine learning are now used across nearly every sector of the economy. Although automation is expected to reduce the number of human roles in production, office support, customer service, and related fields, demand is rising for people who can design, guide, and integrate AI systems, Murugesan and Neamtu write. The guide cites surveys of executives about AI’s effect on their hiring and retention strategies, including those conducted by McKinsey & Co. The reports show staffing shortages in advanced IT and data analytics, as well as applicants’ insufficient critical thinking and creativity: skills that are difficult to automate. The authors frame the mismatch as an opportunity for graduates and early-career professionals to prepare strategically, focusing on capabilities that are likely to remain relevant as AI tools evolve. Developing complementary skills The strategic approach aligns with advice from Neil Thompson, director of FutureTech research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was quoted in the guide. Thompson encourages workers to develop skills that complement AI rather than compete with it. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains,” he says. “Applying AI in science, in particular, has enormous potential right now and the capacity to unlock significant benefits for humanity.” The technical foundation still matters Adaptability, the guide stresses, is not a substitute for technical rigor. A viable AI career still requires a strong foundation in data, machine learning, and computing infrastructure. Core knowledge areas include data structures, large-scale data handling, and tools for data manipulation and analysis, the authors say. Foundational machine-learning concepts, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning, remain essential, they say. Because many AI systems depend on scalable computing, familiarity with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure is important, according to the guide’s authors. Mathematics underpins all of it. Linear algebra, calculus, and probabilities form the basis of most AI algorithms. Python has emerged as the dominant language for building and experimenting with models. From algorithms to frameworks The authors highlight the value of hands-on experience with widely used development frameworks. PyTorch, developed by Meta AI, is commonly used for prototyping deep-learning models in academia and industry. Scikit-learn provides open-source tools for classification, regression, and clustering within the Python ecosystem. “When we see rapid technological progress like this, workers should focus on skills and occupations that apply AI to adjacent domains. —Neil Thompson, MIT TensorFlow, a software library for machine learning and AI created by Google, supports building and deploying machine-learning systems at multiple levels of abstraction. The authors emphasize that such tools matter less as résumé keywords than as vehicles for understanding how models behave within real-world constraints. Soft skills as career insurance Because AI projects often involve ambiguous problems and interdisciplinary teams, soft skills play an increasingly central role, according to the guide. Critical thinking and problem-solving are essential, but communication has become more important, the authors say. Many AI professionals must explain system behavior, limitations, and risks to nontechnical stakeholders. Neamtu describes communication and contextual thinking as timeless skills that grow more valuable as automation expands, particularly when paired with leadership, resilience, and a commitment to continuous learning. Murugesan says technical depth must be matched with the ability to collaborate and adapt. Experience before titles The guide recommends that students consider work on research projects in college, as well as paid internships, for exposure to real AI workflows and job roles with hands-on experience. Building an AI project portfolio is critical. Open-source repositories on platforms such as GitHub allow newcomers to demonstrate applied skills including work on AI security, bias mitigation, and deepfake detection. The guide recommends staying current by reading academic papers, taking courses, and attending conferences. Doing so can help students get a solid grounding in the basics and remain relevant in a fast-moving field after beginning their career. Entry-level roles that open doors Common starting positions include AI research assistant, junior machine-learning engineer, and junior data analyst. The roles typically combine support tasks with opportunities to help develop models, preprocess data, and communicate results through reports and visualizations, according to the guide. Each starting point reinforces the guide’s central message: AI careers are built through collaboration and learning, not merely through isolated technical brilliance. Curiosity as a long-term strategy Murugesan urges aspiring AI professionals to embrace continuous learning, seek mentors, and treat mistakes as part of the learning process. “Always be curious,” he says. “Learn from failure. Mistakes and setbacks are part of the journey. Embrace them and persist.” Neamtu echoes that perspective, noting that AI is likely to affect nearly every profession, making passion for one’s work and compatibility with organizational aims more important than chasing the latest technology trend. In a field where today’s tools can become obsolete in a year, the guide’s core argument is simple: The most future-proof AI career is built not on what you know now but on how well you continue learning when things change.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-developer-career-advice","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-young-adult-woman-working-on-her-desktop-computer-in-an-office.jpg?id=62805163&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C157","publishedAt":"2026-01-15T19:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"The newly released Preparing for a Career as an AI Developer guide from the IEEE Computer Society argues that the most durable path to artificial intelligence jobs is not defined by mastering any single tool or model.

Ended up using atomic operations for counters and a separate goroutine that periodically reads metrics and recalculates weights. Keeps the hot path lock-free. Also had to handle provider health scoring. Not just \"up or down\" but scoring based on recent performance. A provider recovering from issues should gradually earn traffic back, not get slammed immediately. Connection pooling matters more than expected. Go's http.Transport reuses connections well, but tuning MaxIdleConnsPerHost made a noticeable difference under sustained load. Running this at 5K RPS with sub-microsecond overhead now. The concurrency primitives in Go made this way easier than Python would've been. Anyone else built adaptive routing in Go?

Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free! As we enter 2026, we’re taking a look back at the top pieces of advice we shared in the Career Alert newsletter last year. Whether you’re looking for a new job or seeking strategies to excel in your current role, read on for the three most popular recommendations that could help advance your career. 1. Getting Past Procrastination Across a decade working at hypergrowth tech companies like Meta and Pinterest, I constantly struggled with procrastination. I’d be assigned an important project, but I simply couldn’t get myself to start it. The source of my distraction varied—I would constantly check my email, read random documentation, or even scroll through my social feeds. But the result was the same: I felt a deep sense of dread that I was not making progress on the things that mattered. At the end of the day, time is the only resource that matters. With every minute, you are making a decision about how to spend your life. Most of the ways people spend their time are ineffective. Especially in the tech world, our tasks and tools are constantly changing, so we must be able to adapt. What separates the best engineers from the rest of the pack is that they create systems that allow them to be consistently productive. Here’s the core idea that changed my perspective on productivity: Action leads to motivation, not the other way around. You should not check your email or scroll Instagram while you wait for motivation to “hit you.” Instead, just start doing something, anything, that makes progress toward your goal, and you’ll find that motivation will follow.… Read the full newsletter here. 2. Improve Your Chances of Landing That Job Interview One of my close friends is a hiring manager at Google. She recently posted about an open position on her team and was immediately overwhelmed with applications. We’re talking about thousands of applicants within days. What surprised me most, however, was the horrendous quality of the average submission. Most applicants were obviously unqualified or had concocted entirely fake profiles. The use of generative AI to automatically fill out (and, in some cases, even submit) applications is harmful to everyone; employers are unable to filter through the noise, and legitimate candidates have a harder time getting noticed—much less advancing to an interview. So how can job seekers stand out among the deluge of candidates? When there are hundreds or thousands of applicants, the best way to distinguish yourself is by leveraging your network. With AI, anyone with a computer can trivially apply to thousands of jobs. On the other hand, people are restricted by Dunbar’s number—the idea that humans can maintain stable social relationships with only about 150 people. Being one of those 150 people is harder, but it also carries more weight than a soulless job application. Read the full newsletter here. 3. Learning to Code Still Matters in the Age of AI Cursor, the AI-native code editor, recently reported that it writes nearly a billion lines of code daily. That’s one billion lines of production-grade code accepted by users every single day. If we generously assume that a strong engineer writes a thousand lines of code in a day, Cursor is doing the equivalent work of a million developers. (For context, while working at Pinterest and Meta, I’d typically write less than 100 lines of code per day.) There are only about 25 million software developers worldwide! Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete. This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore? The answer is a resounding “yes.” The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.… Read the full newsletter here. —Rahul","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/career-advice-2025","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-stylized-people-wearing-business-casual-clothing.webp?id=62078755&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C112%2C0%2C113","publishedAt":"2026-01-15T18:32:11.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"This article is crossposted from IEEE Spectrum’s careers newsletter.

Database provider MongoDB thinks its newest embeddings models help solve falling retrieval quality as more AI systems go into production. As agentic and RAG systems move into production, retrieval quality is emerging as a quiet failure point — one that can undermine accuracy, cost, and user trust even when models themselves perform well. The company launched four new versions of its embeddings and reranking models. Voyage 4 will be available in four modes: voyage-4 embedding, voyage-4-large, voyage-4-lite, and voyage-4-nano. MongoDB said the voyage-4 embedding serves as its general-purpose model; MongoDB considers Voyage-4-large its flagship model. Voyage-4-lite focuses on tasks requiring little latency and lower costs, and voyage-4-nano is intended for more local development and testing environments or for on-device data retrieval. Voyage-4-nano is also MongoDB’s first open-weight model. All models are available via an API and on MongoDB’s Atlas platform. The company said the models outperform similar models from Google and Cohere on the RTEB benchmark. Hugging Face’s RTEB benchmark puts Voyage 4 as the top embedding model. “Embedding models are one of those invisible choices that can really make or break AI experiences,” Frank Liu, product manager at MongoDB, said in a briefing. “You get them wrong, your search results will feel pretty random and shallow, but if you get them right, your application suddenly feels like it understands your users and your data.” He added that the goal of the Voyage 4 models is to improve the retrieval of real-world data, which often collapses once agentic and RAG pipelines go into production. MongoDB also released a new multimodal embedding model, voyage-multimodal-3.5, that can handle documents that include text, images, and video. This model vectorizes the data and extracts semantic meaning from the tables, graphics, figures, and slides typically found in enterprise documents. Enterprise’s embeddings problems For enterprises, an agentic system is only as good as its ability to reliably retrieve the right information at the right time. This requirement becomes harder as workloads scale and context windows fragment. Several model providers target that layer of agentic AI. Google’s Gemini Embedding model topped the embedding leaderboards, and Cohere launched its Embed 4 multimodal model, which processes documents more than 200 pages long. Mistral said its coding-embedding model, Codestral Embedding, outperforms Cohere, Google, and even MongoDB’s Voyage Code 3. MongoDB argues that benchmark performance alone doesn’t address the operational complexity enterprises face in production. MongoDB said many clients have found that their data stacks cannot handle context-aware, retrieval-intensive workloads in production. The company said it's seeing more fragmentation with enterprises having to stitch together different solutions to connect databases with a retrieval or reranking model. To help customers who don’t want fragmented solutions, the company is offering its models through a single data platform, Atlas. MongoDB’s bet is that retrieval can’t be treated as a loose collection of best-of-breed components anymore. For enterprise agents to work reliably at scale, embeddings, reranking, and the data layer need to operate as a tightly integrated system rather than a stitched-together stack.","url":"https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/why-mongodb-thinks-better-retrieval-not-bigger-models-is-the-key-to","imageUrl":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/3ahIcS5AJ5RCuVRg8hgyxx/86c2a7aa169e87babbfe7f7ffc3700a9/crimedy7_illustration_of_a_robot_poring_through_expense_repor_a03892f6-f441-4dab-a57b-8e664b411198_3.png?w=300&q=30","publishedAt":"2026-01-15T18:00:00.000Z","sourceName":"VentureBeat","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Agentic systems and enterprise search depend on strong data retrieval that works efficiently and accurately.

Developed by independent South African studio Nyamakop, the game focuses on a ragtag crew from Johannesburg that liberates real-life African artifacts from a series of fictionalized Western museums. Relooted is best described as a 2.5d side-scrolling action platformer with stealth and puzzle elements. You have to carefully plan each heist with your fellow teammates, knowing where to place each crew member and how you’re going to get in and out in one piece. Once you’ve grabbed the artifact you’re looking for in each mission, an alarm will sound and you have a limited amount of time to escape, so good preparation is vital. The studio’s previous game, the platformer Semblance, was significant for being the first South Africa-developed IP to come to a Nintendo console when it launched on Switch in 2018. At E3 that same year, Nyamakop programmer Cukia Kimani and designer Ben Myres talked to Engadget about the difficulties of getting your game in front of the major platform-holders as an indie developer based in sub-Saharan Africa. Without notable local industry events or reps in the country, the developers had to do a lot of globe-trotting in order to get their game noticed. At the time of writing there’s no Switch or Switch 2 release lined up for Relooted, but the game is coming to PC and Xbox consoles next month.

It updates specific MLP layers to \"learn\" the current context. Outer Loop: The model's initial weights are meta-learned during training to be \"highly updateable\" or optimized for this test-time adaptation From the Paper: \"Overall, our empirical observations strongly indicate that TTT-E2E should produce the same trend as full attention for scaling with training compute in large-budget production runs.\" Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7x faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available. Layman's Explanation: Think of this paper as solving the memory bottleneck by fundamentally changing how a model processes information. Imagine you are taking a massive open-book exam. A standard Transformer (like GPT-4) is the student who frantically re-reads every single page of the textbook before answering every single question. This strategy guarantees they find the specific details (perfect recall), but as the textbook gets thicker, they get exponentially slower until they simply cannot finish the test in time. On the other hand, alternatives like RNNs or Mamba try to summarize the entire textbook onto a single index card. They can answer questions instantly because they don't have to look back at the book, but for long, complex subjects, they eventually run out of space on the card and start forgetting crucial information. This new method, Test-Time Training (TTT), changes the paradigm from retrieving information to learning it on the fly. Instead of re-reading the book or summarizing it onto a card, the TTT model treats the context window as a dataset and actually trains itself on it in real-time. It performs a mini-gradient descent update on its own neural weights as it reads. This is equivalent to a student who reads the textbook and physically rewires their brain to master the subject matter before the test. Because the information is now compressed into the model's actual intelligence (its weights) rather than a temporary cache, the model can answer questions instantly (matching the constant speed of the fast index-card models) but with the high accuracy and scaling capability of the slow, page-turning Transformers. This effectively decouples intelligence from memory costs, allowing for massive context lengths without the usual slowdown.

Curious if a workflow-native, outcome-driven approach could. [D]","summary":"Hi everyone I’m a fellowship-trained neurosurgeon / spine surgeon. I’ve been discussing a persistent problem in our field with other surgeons for a while, and I wanted to run it by people who think about ML systems, not just model performance. I’m trying to pressure-test whether a particular approach is even technically sound, where it would break, and what I’m likely underestimating. Id love to find an interested person to have a discussion with to get a 10000 feet level understanding of the scope of what I am trying to accomplish. The clinical problem: For the same spine pathology and very similar patient presentations, you can see multiple reputable surgeons and get very different surgical recommendations. anything from continued conservative management to decompression, short fusion, or long multilevel constructs. Costs and outcomes vary widely. This isn’t because surgeons are careless. It’s because spine surgery operates with: Limited prospective evidence Inconsistent documentation Weak outcome feedback loops Retrospective datasets that are biased, incomplete, and poorly labeled EMRs are essentially digital paper charts. PACS is built for viewing images, not capturing decision intent. Surgical reasoning is visual, spatial, and 3D, yet we reduce it to free-text notes after the fact. From a data perspective, the learning signal is pretty broken. Why I’m skeptical that training on existing data works: “Labels” are often inferred indirectly (billing codes, op notes) Surgeon decision policies are non-stationary Available datasets are institution-specific and access-restricted Selection bias is extreme (who gets surgery vs who doesn’t is itself a learned policy) Outcomes are delayed, noisy, and confounded Even with access, I’m not convinced retrospective supervision converges to something clinically useful. The idea I’m exploring: Instead of trying to clean bad data later, what if the workflow itself generated structured, high-fidelity labels as a byproduct of doing the work, or at least the majority of it? Concretely, I’m imagining an EMR-adjacent, spine-specific surgical planning and case monitoring environment that surgeons would actually want to use. Not another PACS viewer, but a system that allows: 3D reconstruction from pre-op imaging Automated calculation of alignment parameters Explicit marking of anatomic features tied to symptoms Surgical plan modeling (levels, implants, trajectories, correction goals) Structured logging of surgical cases (to derive patterns and analyze for trends) Enable productivity (generate note, auto populate plans ect.) Enable standardized automated patient outcomes data collection. The key point isn’t the UI, but UI is also an area that currently suffers. It’s that surgeons would be forced (in a useful way) to externalize decision intent in a structured format because it directly helps them plan cases and generate documentation. Labeling wouldn’t feel like labeling it would almost just be how you work. The data used for learning would explicitly include post-operative outcomes. PROMs collected at standardized intervals, complications (SSI, reoperation), operative time, etc, with automated follow-up built into the system. The goal would not be to replicate surgeon decisions, but to learn decision patterns that are associated with better outcomes. Surgeons could specify what they want to optimize for a given patient (eg pain relief vs complication risk vs durability), and the system would generate predictions conditioned on those objectives. Over time, this would generate: Surgeon-specific decision + outcome datasets Aggregate cross-surgeon data Explicit representations of surgical choices, not just endpoints Learning systems could then train on: Individual surgeon decision–outcome mappings Population-level patterns Areas of divergence where similar cases lead to different choices and outcomes Where I’m unsure, and why I’m posting here: From an ML perspective, I’m trying to understand: Given delayed, noisy outcomes, is this best framed as supervised prediction or closer to learning decision policies under uncertainty? How feasible is it to attribute outcome differences to surgical decisions rather than execution, environment, or case selection? Does it make sense to learn surgeon-specific decision–outcome mappings before attempting cross-surgeon generalization? How would you prevent optimizing for measurable metrics (PROMs, SSI, etc) at the expense of unmeasured but important patient outcomes? Which outcome signals are realistically usable for learning, and which are too delayed or confounded? What failure modes jump out immediately? I’m also trying to get a realistic sense of: The data engineering complexity this implies Rough scale of compute once models actually exist The kind of team required to even attempt this (beyond just training models) I know there are a lot of missing details.

Imec recently explored this scenario using advanced thermal simulations, and the answer—delivered in December at the 2025 IEEE International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM)—was a bit grim. 3D stacking doubles the operating temperature inside the GPU, rendering it inoperable. But the team, led by Imec’s James Myers, didn’t just give up. They identified several engineering optimizations that ultimately could whittle down the temperature difference to nearly zero. 2.5D and 3D Advanced Packaging Imec started with a thermal simulation of a GPU and four HBM dies as you’d find them today, inside what’s called a 2.5D package. That is, both the GPU and the HBM sit on substrate called an interposer, with minimal distance between them. The two types of chips are linked by thousands of micrometer-scale copper interconnects built into the interposer’s surface. In this configuration, the model GPU consumes 414 watts and reaches a peak temperature of just under 70 °C—typical for a processor. The memory chips consume an additional 40 W or so and get somewhat less hot. The heat is removed from the top of the package by the kind of liquid cooling that’s become common in new AI data centers. RELATED: Future Chips Will Be Hotter Than Ever “While this approach is currently used, it does not scale well for the future—especially as it blocks two sides of the GPU, limiting future GPU-to-GPU connections inside the package,” Yukai Chen, a senior researcher at Imec, told engineers at IEDM. In contrast, “the 3D approach leads to higher bandwidth, lower latency.… The most important improvement is the package footprint.” Unfortunately, as Chen and his colleagues found, the most straightforward version of stacking, simply putting the HBM chips on top of the GPU and adding a block of blank silicon to fill in a gap at the center, shot up temperatures in the GPU to a scorching 140 °C—well past a typical GPU’s 80 °C limit. System Technology Co-optimization The Imec team set about trying a number of technology and system optimizations aimed at lowering the temperature. The first thing they tried was throwing out a layer of silicon that was now redundant. To understand why, you have to first get a grip on what HBM really is. This form of memory is a stack of as many as 12 high-density DRAM dies. Each has been thinned down to tens of micrometers and is shot through with vertical connections. These thinned dies are stacked one atop another and connected by tiny balls of solder, and this stack of memory is vertically connected to another piece of silicon, called the base die. The base die is a logic chip designed to multiplex the data—pack it into the limited number of wires that can fit across the millimeter-scale gap to the GPU. But with the HBM now on top of the GPU, there’s no need for such a data pump. Bits can flow directly into the processor without regard for how many wires happen to fit along the side of the chip. Of course, this change means moving the memory control circuits from the base die into the GPU and therefore changing the processor’s floorplan, says Myers. But there should be ample room, he suggests, because the GPU will no longer need the circuits used to demultiplex incoming memory data. RELATED: The Hot, Hot Future of Chips Cutting out this middleman of memory cooled things down by only a little less than 4 °C. But, importantly, it should massively boost the bandwidth between the memory and the processor, which is important for another optimization the team tried—slowing down the GPU. That might seem contrary to the whole purpose of better AI computing, but in this case, it’s an advantage. Large language models are what are called “memory-bound” problems. That is, memory bandwidth is the main limiting factor. But Myers’s team estimated 3D stacking HBM on the GPU would boost bandwidth fourfold. With that added headroom, even slowing the GPU’s clock by 50 percent still leads to a performance win, while cooling everything down by more than 20 °C. In practice, the processor might not need to be slowed down quite that much. Increasing the clock frequency to 70 percent led to a GPU that was only 1.7 °C warmer, Myers says. Optimized HBM Another big drop in temperature came from making the HBM stack and the area around it more conductive. That included merging the four stacks into two wider stacks, thereby eliminating a heat-trapping region; thinning out the top—usually thicker—die of the stack; and filling in more of the space around the HBM with blank pieces of silicon to conduct more heat. With all of that, the stack now operated at about 88 °C. One final optimization brought things back to near 70 °C. Generally, some 95 percent of a chip’s heat is removed from the top of the package, where in this case water carries the heat away. But adding similar cooling to the underside as well drove the stacked chips down a final 17 °C. Although the research presented at IEDM shows it might be possible, HBM-on-GPU isn’t necessarily the best choice, Myers says. “We are simulating other system configurations to help build confidence that this is or isn’t the best choice,” he says. “GPU-on-HBM is of interest to some in industry,” because it puts the GPU closer to the cooling. But it would likely be a more complex design, because the GPU’s power and data would have to flow vertically through the HBM to reach it.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hbm-on-gpu-imec-iedm","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/close-up-of-an-amd-chip-s-die-face.jpg?id=62725707&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188","publishedAt":"2026-01-14T17:00:03.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Peek inside the package of AMD’s or Nvidia’s most advanced AI products, and you’ll find a familiar arrangement: The GPU is flanked on two sides by high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the most advanced memory chips available.

For decades, engineers have sought OLEDs that can bend, twist, and stretch while maintaining bright and stable light. These displays could be integrated into a new class of devices—woven into clothing fabric, for example, to show real-time information, like a runner’s speed or heart rate, without breaking or dimming. But engineers have always encountered a trade-off: The more you stretch these materials, the dimmer they become. Now, a group co-led by Yury Gogotsi, a materials scientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, has found a way around the problem by employing a special class of materials called MXenes—which Gogotsi helped discover—that maintain brightness while being significantly stretched. The team developed an OLED that can stretch to twice its original size while keeping a steady glow. It also converts electricity into light more efficiently than any stretchable OLED before it, reaching a record 17 percent external quantum efficiency—a measure of how efficiently a device turns electricity into light. The “Perfect Replacement” Gogotsi didn’t have much experience with OLEDs when, about five years ago, he teamed up with Tae-Woo Lee, a materials scientist at Seoul National University, to develop better flexible OLEDs, driven by the ever-increasing use of flexible electronics like foldable phones. Traditionally, the displays are built from multiple stacked layers. At the base, a cathode supplies electrons that enter the adjacent organic layers, which are designed to conduct this charge efficiently. As the electrons move through these layers, they meet positive charge injected by an indium tin oxide (ITO) film. The moment these charges combine, the organic material releases energy as light, creating the illuminated pixels that make up the image. The entire structure is sealed with a glass layer on top. The ITO film—adhered to the glass—serves as the anode, allowing current to pass through the organic layers without blocking the generated light. “But it’s brittle. It’s ceramic, basically,” so it works well for flat surfaces, but can’t be bent, Gogotsi explains. There have been attempts to engineer flexible OLEDs many times before, but they failed to meaningfully overcome both flexibility and brightness limitations. Gogotsi’s students started by creating a transparent, conducting film out of a MXene, a type of ultrathin and flexible material with metal-like conductivity. The material is unique in its inherent ability to bend because it’s made from many two-dimensional sheets that can slide relative to each other without breaking. The film—only 10 nanometers thick—“appeared to be this perfect replacement for ITO,” Gogotsi says. Through experimentation, Gogotsi and Lee’s shared team found that a mix of the MXene and silver nanowire would actually stretch the most while maintaining stability. “We were able to double the size, achieving 200 percent stretching without losing performance,” Gogotsi says. The new material can also be twisted without losing its glow.Source image: Huanyu Zhou, Hyun-Wook Kim, et al. And the new MXene film was not only more flexible than ITO but also increased brightness by almost an order of magnitude by making the contact between the topmost light-emitting organic layer and the film more efficient. Unlike ITO, the surface of MXenes can be chemically adjusted to make it easier for electrons to move from the electrode into the light-emitting layer. This more efficient electron flow significantly increases the brightness of the display, as evidenced by an external quantum efficiency of 17 percent, which the group claims is a record for stretchable OLEDs. “Achieving those numbers in intrinsically stretchable OLEDs under substantial stretching is quite significant,” says Seunghyup Yoo, who runs the Integrated Organic Electronics Laboratory at South Korea’s KAIST. An external quantum efficiency of 20 percent is an important benchmark for this kind of device because it is the upper limit of efficiency dictated by the physical properties of light generation, Yoo explains. To increase illumination, the researchers went beyond working with MXene. Lee’s group developed two additional organic layers to add into the middle of their OLED—one that directs positive charges to the light-emitting layer, ensuring that electricity is used more efficiently, and one that recycles wasted energy that would normally be lost, boosting overall brightness. Together, the MXene layer and two organic layers allow for a notably bright and stable OLED, even when stretched. Gogotsi thinks the subsequent OLED is “very successful” because it combines both brightness and stretchability, while, historically, engineers have only been able to achieve one or the other. “The performance that they are able to achieve in this work is an important advancement,” says Sihong Wang, a molecular engineer at the University of Chicago who also develops stretchable OLED materials. Wang also notes that the 200 percent stretchability that Gogotsi’s group attained is beyond robust for wearable applications. Wearables and Health Care A stretchable OLED that maintains its brightness has uses in many settings, including industrial environments, robotics, wearable clothing and devices, and communications, Gogotsi says, although he’s most excited about its adoption in health-monitoring devices. He sees a near future in which displays for diagnostics and treatment become embedded in clothing or “epidermal electronics,” comparing their function to smartwatches. Before these displays can come to market, however, stability issues inherent to all stretchable OLEDs need to be solved, Wang says. Current materials are not able to sustain light emissions for long enough to serve customers in the ways they require. Finding housings to protect them is also a problem. “You need a stretchable encapsulation material that can protect the central device without allowing oxygen and moisture to permeate,” Wang says. Yoo agrees: He says it’s a tough problem to solve because the best protective layers are rigid and not very stretchable. He notes yet another challenge in the way of commercialization, which is “developing stretchable displays that do not exhibit image distortion.” Regardless, Gogotsi is excited about the future of stretchable OLEDs. “We started with computers occupying the room, then moved to our desktops, then to laptops, then we got smartphones and iPads, but still we carry stuff with us,” he says. “Flexible displays can be on the sleeve of your jacket. They can be rolled into a tube or folded and put in your pocket. They can be everywhere.”","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stretchable-oleds-wearable-display-drexel","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-bi-axially-stretched-exciplex-assisted-phosphorescent-film-deposited-on-a-small-stretchable-substrate.jpg?id=62303035&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188","publishedAt":"2026-01-14T16:00:04.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Wearable displays are catching up with phones and smartwatches.

Grid operators had earlier shut down the 115-kilovolt circuit, but six high-voltage lines that shared the corridor were still operating, and some of their power snuck onto the deenergized wires he was working on. That rogue current shot to the ground through Kropp’s body and his elevated work platform, killing the 32-year-old father of two. “It went in both of his hands and came out his stomach, where he was leaning against the platform rail,” says Justin’s father, Barry Kropp, who is himself a retired line worker. “Justin got hung up on the wire. When they finally got him on the ground, it was too late.” Budapest-based Electrostatics makes conductive suits that protect line workers from unexpected current. Electrostatics Justin’s accident was caused by induction: a hazard that occurs when an electric or magnetic field causes current to flow through equipment whose intended power supply has been cut off. Safety practices seek to prevent such induction shocks by grounding all conductive objects in a work zone, giving electricity alternative paths. But accidents happen. In Justin’s case, his platform unexpectedly swung into the line before it could be grounded. Conductive Suits Protect Line Workers Adding a layer of defense against induction injuries is the motivation behind Budapest-based Electrostatics’ specialized conductive jumpsuits, which are designed to protect against burns, cardiac fibrillation, and other ills. “If my boy had been wearing one, I know he’d be alive today,” says the elder Kropp, who purchased a line-worker safety training business after Justin’s death. The Mesa, Ariz.–based company, Electrical Safety Consulting International (ESCI), now distributes those suits. Conductive socks that are connected to the trousers complete the protective suit. BME HVL Eduardo Ramirez Bettoni, one of the developers of the suits, dug into induction risk after a series of major accidents in the United States in 2017 and 2018, including Justin Kropp’s. At the time, he was principal engineer for transmission and substation standards at Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy. In talking to Xcel line workers and fellow safety engineers, he sensed that the accident cluster might be the tip of an iceberg. And when he and two industry colleagues scoured data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, they found 81 induction accidents between 1985 and 2021 and 60 deaths, which they documented in a 2022 report. “Unfortunately, it is really common. I would say there are hundreds of induction contacts every year in the United States alone,” says Ramirez Bettoni, who is now technical director of R&D for the Houston-based power-distribution equipment firm Powell Industries. He bets that such “contacts”—exposures to dangerous levels of induction—are increasing as grid operators boost grid capacity by squeezing additional circuits into transmission corridors. Electrostatics’ suits are an enhancement of the standard protective gear that line workers wear when their tasks involve working close to or even touching energized live lines, or “bare-hands” work. Both are interwoven with conductive materials such as stainless steel threads, which form a Faraday cage that shields the wearer against the lines’ electric fields. But the standard suits have limited capacity to shunt current because usually they don’t need to. Like a bird on a wire, bare-hands workers are electrically floating, rather than grounded, so current largely bypasses them via the line itself. Induction Safety Suit Design Backed by a US $250,000 investment from Xcel in 2019, Electrostatics adapted its standard suits by adding low-resistance conductive straps that pass current around a worker’s body. “When I’m touching a conductor with one hand and the other hand is grounded, the current will flow through the straps to get out,” says Bálint Németh, Electrostatics’ CEO and director of the High Voltage Laboratory at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. A strapping system links all the elements of the suit—the jacket, trousers, gloves, and socks—and guides current through a controlled path outside the body. BME HVL The company began selling the suits in 2023, and they have since been adopted by over a dozen transmission operators in the United States and Europe, as well as other countries including Canada, Indonesia, and Turkey. They cost about $5,200 in the United States. Electrostatics’ suits had to meet a crucial design threshold: keeping body exposure below the 6-milliampere “let-go” threshold, beyond which electrocuted workers become unable to remove themselves from a circuit. “If you lose control of your muscles, you’re going to hold onto the conductor until you pass out or possibly die,” says Ramirez Bettoni. The gear, which includes the suit, gloves, and socks, protects against 100 amperes for 10 seconds and 50 A for 30 seconds. It also has insulation to protect against heat created by high current and flame retardants to protect against electric arcs. Kropp, Németh, and Ramirez Bettoni are hoping that developing industry standards for induction safety gear, including ones published in October, will broaden their use. Meanwhile, the recently enacted Justin Kropp Safety Act in California, for which the elder Kropp lobbied, mandates automated defibrillators at power-line work sites.

But the bumpy conditions didn’t thwart its mission: to wirelessly beam power down to receivers on the ground as it flew by. The test flight marked the first time power has been beamed from a moving aircraft. It was conducted by the Ashburn, Va.-based startup Overview Energy, which emerged from stealth mode in December by announcing the feat. But the greater purpose of the flight was to demonstrate the feasibility of a much grander ambition: to beam power from space to Earth. Overview plans to launch satellites into geosynchronous orbit (GEO) to collect unfiltered solar energy where the sun never sets and then beam this abundance back to humanity. The solar energy would be transferred as near-infrared waves and received by existing solar panels on the ground. The far-flung strategy, known as space-based solar power, has become the subject of both daydreaming and serious research over the past decade. Caltech’s Space Solar Power Project launched a demonstration mission in 2023 that transferred power in space using microwaves. And terrestrial power beaming is coming along too. The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in July 2025 set a new record for wirelessly transmitting power: 800 watts over 8.6 kilometers for 30 seconds using a laser beam. But until November, no one had actively beamed power from a moving platform to a ground receiver. Wireless Power Beaming Goes Airborne Overview’s test transferred only a sprinkling of power, but it did it with the same components and techniques that the company plans to send to space. “Not only is it the first optical power beaming from a moving platform at any substantial range or power,” says Overview CEO Marc Berte, “but also it’s the first time anyone’s really done a power beaming thing where it’s all of the functional pieces all working together. It’s the same methodology and function that we will take to space and scale up in the long term.” The approach was compelling enough that power-beaming expert Paul Jaffe left his job as a program manager at DARPA to join the company as head of systems engineering. Prior to DARPA, Jaffe spent three decades with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. “This actually sounds like it could work.” –Paul Jaffe It was hearing Berte explain Overview’s plan at a conference that helped to convince Jaffe to take a chance on the startup. “This actually sounds like it could work,” Jaffe remembers thinking at the time. “It really seems like it gets around a lot of the showstoppers for a lot of the other concepts. I remember coming home and telling my wife that I almost felt like the problem had been solved. So I thought: Should [I] do something which is almost unheard of—to leave in the middle of being a DARPA program manager—to try to do something else?” For Jaffe, the most compelling reason was in Overview’s solution for space-based solar’s power-density problem. A beam with low power density is safer because it’s not blasting too much concentrated energy onto a single spot on the Earth’s surface, but it’s less efficient for the task of delivering usable solar energy. A higher-density beam does the job better, but then the researchers must engineer some way to maintain safety. Startup Overview Energy demonstrates how space-based solar power could be beamed to Earth from satellites. Overview Energy Space-Based Solar Power Makes Waves Many researchers have settled on microwaves as their beam of choice for wireless power. But, in addition to the safety concerns about shooting such intense waves at the Earth, Jaffe says there’s another problem: Microwaves are part of what he calls the “beachfront property” of the electromagnetic spectrum—a range from 2 to 20 gigahertz that is set aside for many other applications, such as 5G cellular networks. “The fact is,” Jaffe says, “if you somehow magically had a fully operational solar power satellite that used microwave power transmission in orbit today—and a multi-kilometer-scale microwave power satellite receiver on the ground magically in place today—you could not turn it on because the spectrum is not allocated to do this kind of transmission.” Instead, Overview plans to use less-dense, wide-field infrared waves. Existing utility-scale solar farms would be able to receive the beamed energy just like they receive the sun’s energy during daylight hours. So “your receivers are already built,” Berte says. The next major step is a prototype demonstrator for low Earth orbit, after which he hopes to have GEO satellites beaming megawatts of power by 2030 and gigawatts by later that decade. Plenty of doubts about the feasibility of space-based power abound. It is an exotic technology with much left to prove, including the ability to survive orbital debris and the exorbitant cost of launching the power stations. (Overview’s satellite will be built on Earth in a folded configuration, and it will unfold after it’s brought to orbit, according to the company.) “Getting down the cost per unit mass for launch is a big deal,” Jaffe says. “Then, it just becomes a question of increasing the specific power. A lot of the technologies we’re working on at Overview are squarely focused on that.”","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wireless-power-movin-airplane","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/silhouette-of-an-aircraft-with-widespread-beams-of-light-shining-down-from-its-body.jpg?id=62704978&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C261%2C0%2C262","publishedAt":"2026-01-12T14:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"On a blustery November day, a Cessna turboprop flew over Pennsylvania at 5,000 meters, in crosswinds of up to 70 knots—nearly as fast as the little plane was flying.

This includes the gas and dust of the interstellar medium, planet-forming disks, and objects that cannot be observed in visible light. In this field, the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile stands out as one of the world’s most powerful radio telescopes. Using its 66 parabolic antennas, ALMA observes the millimeter and submillimeter radiation emitted by cold molecular clouds from which new stars are born. Each antenna is equipped with high-frequency receivers for 10 wavelength ranges, 35 to 50 gigahertz and 787 to 950 GHz, collectively known as Band 1. Thanks to the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics (IAF) and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, ALMA has received an upgrade with the addition of 145 new low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). These amplifiers are part of the facilities’ Band 2 coverage, ranging from 67 to 116 GHz on the electromagnetic spectrum. This additional coverage will allow researchers to study and gain a better understanding of the universe. In particular, they hope to gain new insights into the “cold interstellar medium”: The dust, gas, radiation, and magnetic fields from which stars are born. In addition, scientists will be able to study planet-forming disks in better detail. Last, but certainly not least, they will be able to study complex organic molecules in nearby galaxies, which are considered precursors to the building blocks of life. In short, these studies will allow astronomers and cosmologists to witness how stars and planetary systems form and evolve, and how the presence of organic molecules can lead to the emergence of life. Advanced Amplifiers Enhance ALMA Sensitivity Each LNA includes a series of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) developed by Fraunhofer IAF using the semiconducting material indium gallium arsenide. MMICs are based on metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistor technology, a method for creating advanced transistors that are flexible and allow for optimized performance in high-frequency receivers. The addition of LNAs equipped with these circuits will amplify low-noise signals and minimize background noise, dramatically increasing the sensitivity of ALMA’s receivers. Fabian Thome, head of the subproject at Fraunhofer IAF, explained in an IAF press release: “The performance of receivers depends largely on the performance of the first high-frequency amplifiers installed in them. Our technology is characterized by an average noise temperature of 22 K, which is unmatched worldwide.” With the new LNAs, signals can be amplified more than 300-fold in the first step. “This enables the ALMA receivers to measure millimeter and submillimeter radiation from the depths of the universe much more precisely and obtain better data. We are incredibly proud that our LNA technology is helping us to better understand the origins of stars and entire galaxies.” Both Fraunhofer IAF and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy were commissioned by the European Southern Observatory to provide the amplifiers. While Fraunhofer IAF was responsible for designing, manufacturing, and testing the MMICs at room temperature, Max Planck was tasked with assembling and qualifying the LNA modules, then testing them in cryogenic conditions. “This is a wonderful recognition of our fantastic collaboration with Fraunhofer IAF, which shows that our amplifiers are not only ‘made in Germany’ but also the best in the world,” said Michael Kramer, executive director at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/atacama-large-millimeter-array","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/several-atacama-large-millimeter-submillimeter-array-antennas-pointed-up-at-a-starry-night-sky.jpg?id=62687462&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C63","publishedAt":"2026-01-11T14:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"For decades, scientists have observed the cosmos with radio antennas to visualize the dark, distant regions of the universe.

The new platform, set to reach customers later this year, is advertised to offer a tenfold reduction in inference costs and a fourfold reduction in how many GPUs it would take to train certain models, as compared to Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture. The usual suspect for improved performance is the GPU. Indeed, the new Rubin GPU boasts 50 quadrillion floating-point operations per second (petaFLOPS) of 4-bit computation, as compared to 10 petaflops on Blackwell, at least for transformer-based inference workloads like large language models. However, focusing on just the GPU misses the bigger picture. There are a total of six new chips in the Vera Rubin-based computers: the Vera CPU, the Rubin GPU, and four distinct networking chips. To achieve performance advantages, the components have to work in concert, says Gilad Shainer, senior vice president of networking at Nvidia. “The same unit connected in a different way will deliver a completely different level of performance,” Shainer says. “That’s why we call it extreme co-design.” Expanded “in-network compute” AI workloads, both training and inference, run on large numbers of GPUs simultaneously. “Two years back, inferencing was mainly run on a single GPU, a single box, a single server,” Shainer says. “Right now, inferencing is becoming distributed, and it’s not just in a rack. It’s going to go across racks.” To accommodate these hugely distributed tasks, as many GPUs as possible need to effectively work as one. This is the aim of the so-called scale-up network: the connection of GPUs within a single rack. Nvidia handles this connection with their NVLink networking chip. The new line includes the NVLink6 switch, with double the bandwidth of the previous version (3,600 gigabytes per second for GPU-to-GPU connections, as compared to 1,800 GB/s for the NVLink5 switch). In addition to the bandwidth doubling, the scale-up chips also include double the number of SerDes—serializer/deserializers (which allow data to be sent across fewer wires)—and an expanded number of calculations that can be done within the network. “The scale-up network is not really the network itself,” Shainer says. “It’s computing infrastructure, and some of the computing operations are done on the network…on the switch.” The rationale for offloading some operations from the GPUs to the network is twofold. First, it allows some tasks to only be done once, rather than having every GPU have to perform them. A common example of this is the all-reduce operation in AI training. During training, each GPU computes a mathematical operation, called a gradient, on its own batch of data. In order to train the model correctly, all the GPUs need to know the average gradient computed across all batches. Rather than each GPU sending its gradient to every other GPU, and every one of them computing the average, it saves computational time and power for that operation to only happen once, within the network. A second rationale is to hide the time it takes to shuttle data in between GPUs by doing computations on them en route. Shainer explains this via an analogy of a pizza parlor trying to speed up the time it takes to deliver an order. “What can you do if you had more ovens or more workers? It doesn’t help you; you can make more pizzas, but the time for a single pizza is going to stay the same. Alternatively, if you would take the oven and put it in a car, so I’m going to bake the pizza while traveling to you, this is where I save time. This is what we do.” In-network computing is not new to this iteration of Nvidia’s architecture. In fact, it has been in common use since around 2016. But, this iteration adds a broader swath of computations that can be done within the network to accommodate different workloads and different numerical formats, Shainer says. Scaling out and across The rest of the networking chips included in the Rubin architecture comprise the so-called scale-out network. This is the part that connects different racks to each other within the data center. Those chips are the ConnectX-9, a networking interface card; the BlueField-4 a so-called data processing unit, which is paired with two Vera CPUs and a ConnectX-9 card for offloading networking, storage, and security tasks; and finally the Spectrum-6 Ethernet switch, which uses co-packaged optics to send data between racks. The Ethernet switch also doubles the bandwidth of the previous generations while minimizing jitter—the variation in arrival times of information packets. “Scale-out infrastructure needs to make sure that those GPUs can communicate well in order to run a distributed computing workload, and that means I need a network that has no jitter in it,” he says. The presence of jitter implies that if different racks are doing different parts of the calculation, the answer from each will arrive at different times. One rack will always be slower than the rest, and the rest of the racks, full of costly equipment, sit idle while waiting for that last packet. “Jitter means losing money,” Shainer says. None of Nvidia’s host of new chips are specifically dedicated to connect between data centers, termed “scale-across.” But Shainer argues this is the next frontier. “It doesn’t stop here, because we are seeing the demands to increase the number of GPUs in a data center,” he says. “100,000 GPUs is not enough anymore for some workloads, and now we need to connect multiple data centers together.”","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-rubin-networking","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/nvidia-s-vera-rubin-ai-supercomputer-made-up-of-several-racks-of-cpus-and-gpus.jpg?id=62697156&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C63","publishedAt":"2026-01-10T14:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Earlier this week, Nvidia surprise-announced their new Vera Rubin architecture (no relation to the recently unveiled telescope) at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The commercial jet airliners severed columns and started fires, weakening steel beams, and causing a “pancaking,” progressive collapse. Skyscrapers had not been designed or constructed with that kind of catastrophic structural failure in mind. IEEE Senior Member Sena Kizildemir is changing that through disaster simulation, one scenario at a time. Sena Kizildemir Employer Thornton Tomasetti, in New York City Job title Project engineer Member grade Senior member Alma maters Işik University in Şile and Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, Pa. A project engineer at Thornton Tomasetti’s applied science division in New York, Kizildemir uses simulations to study how buildings fail under extreme events such as impacts and explosions. The simulation results can help designers develop mitigation strategies. “Simulations help us understand what could happen before it occurs in real life,” she says, “to be able to better plan for it.” She loves that her work mixes creativity with solving real-world problems, she says: “You’re creating something to help people. My favorite question to answer is, ‘Can you make this better or easier?’” For her work, the nonprofit Professional Women in Construction named her one of its 20 Under 40: Women in Construction for 2025. Kizildemir is passionate about mentoring young engineers and being an IEEE volunteer. She says she has made it her mission to “pack as much impact into my years as possible.” A bright student in Türkiye She was born in Istanbul to a father who is a professional drummer and a mother who worked in magazine advertising and sales. Kizildemir and her older brother pursued engineering careers despite neither parent being involved in the field. While she became an expert in civil and mechanical engineering, her brother is an industrial engineer. As a child, she was full of curiosity, she says, interested in figuring out how things were built and how they worked. She loved building objects out of Legos, she says, and one of her earliest memories is using them to make miniature houses for ants. After acing an entrance exam, she won a spot in a STEM-focused high school, where she studied mathematics and physics. “Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.” During her final year at the high school, she took the nationwide YKS (Higher Education Foundations Examination). The test determines which universities and programs—such as medicine, engineering, or law—students can pursue. She received a full scholarship to attend Işik University in Şile. Figuring she would study engineering abroad one day, she chose an English-taught program. She says she found that civil engineering best aligned with making the biggest impact on her community and the world. Several of her professors were alumni of Lehigh University, in Bethlehem, Pa., and spoke highly of the school. After earning her bachelor’s degree in civil engineering in 2016, she decided to attend Lehigh, where she earned a full scholarship to its master’s program in civil engineering. Moving abroad and working the rails Her master’s thesis focused on investigating root causes of crack propagation, which threatens railroad safety. Repeated wheel-rail loading causes microcracks, leading to metal fatigue, and residual stress results from specialized heating and cooling treatments during the manufacturing of steel rails. Cracks can develop beneath the rail’s surface. Because they’re invisible to the naked eye, such fractures are challenging to detect, Kizildemir says. The project was done in collaboration with the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration—part of the Department of Transportation—which is looking to adjust technical standards and employ mitigation strategies. Kizildemir and five colleagues designed and implemented testing protocols and physics-based simulations to detect cracks earlier and prevent their spread. Their research has given the Railroad Administration insights into structural defects that are being used to revise rail-building guidelines and inspection protocols. The administration published the first phase of the research in 2024. After graduating in 2018, Kizildemir began a summer internship as a civil engineer at Thornton Tomasetti. She conducted computational modeling using Abaqus software for rails subjected to repeated plastic deformation—material that permanently changes shape when under excessive stress—and presented her recommendations for improvement to the company’s management. During her internship, she worked with professors in different fields, including materials behavior and mechanical engineering. The experience, she says, inspired her to pursue a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh, continuing her research with the Railroad Administration. She earned her degree in 2023. She loved the work and the team at Thornton Tomasetti so much, she says, that she applied to work at the company, where she is now a project engineer. From simulations to real-world applications Her work focuses on developing finite element models for critical infrastructure and extreme events. Finite modeling breaks complex systems or topics into small elements connected together to numerically simulate real-world situations. She creates computational models of structures enduring realistic catastrophic events, such as a vehicle crashing into a building. She uses simulations to understand how buildings react to attacks such as the one on 9/11, which, she says, is often used as an example of why such research is essential. When starting a project, she and her team review building standards and try to identify new issues not yet covered by them. The team then adapts existing codes and standards, usually developed for well-understood hazards such as earthquakes, wind, and floods, to define simulation parameters. When a new structure is being built, for example, it is not designed to withstand a truck crashing into it. But Kizildemir and her team want to know how the building would react should that happen. They simulate the environments and situations, and they make recommendations based on the results to reduce or eliminate risks of structural failure. Mitigation suggestions include specific strategies to be implemented during project design and construction. Simulations can be created for any infrastructure, Kizildemir says. “I love problems that force me to think differently,” she says. “I want to keep growing.” She says she plans to live by Thornton Tomasetti’s internal motto: “When others say no, we say ‘Here’s how.’” Joining IEEE and getting more involved When Kizildemir first heard of IEEE, she assumed it was only for electrical engineers. But after learning how diverse and inclusive the organization is, she joined in 2024. She has since been elevated to a senior member and has become a volunteer. She joined the IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society. She chaired the conference tracks and IEEE-sponsored sessions at the 2024 Joint Rail Conference, held in Columbia, S.C. She actively contributes to IEEE’s Collabratec platform and has participated in panel review meetings for senior member elevation applications. She’s also a member of ASME and has been volunteering for it since 2023. “Community is what helped get me to where I am today, and I want to pay it forward and make the field better,” she says. “Helping others improves ourselves.” Looking ahead and giving back Kizildemir mentors junior engineers at Thornton Thomasetti and is looking to expand her reach through IEEE’s mentorship programs. “Engineering doesn’t have a gender requirement,” she says she tells girls. “If you’re curious and like understanding how things work and get excited to solve difficult problems, engineering is for you. “Civil engineers don’t just build bridges,” she adds. “There are countless niche areas to be explored. Engineering is one of the few careers where you can make a lasting impact on the world, and I plan on mine being meaningful.” Kizildemir says she wants every engineer to be able to improve their community. Her main piece of advice for recent engineering graduates is that “curiosity, discipline, and the willingness to understand things deeply, to see how things can be done better,” are the keys to success.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/sena-kizildemir-simulation-disasters","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/portrait-of-sena-kizildemir-against-a-texture-background-of-cracked-concrete.jpg?id=62694914&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C62%2C0%2C63","publishedAt":"2026-01-09T19:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"When two airplanes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on 11 September 2001, no one could predict how the Twin Towers would react structurally.

After two years of steady improvements, over the course of 2025, most of the core models reached a quality plateau, and more recently, seem to be in decline. A task that might have taken five hours assisted by AI, and perhaps 10 hours without it, is now more commonly taking seven or eight hours, or even longer. It’s reached the point where I am sometimes going back and using older versions of large language models (LLMs). I use LLM-generated code extensively in my role as CEO of Carrington Labs, a provider of predictive-analytics risk models for lenders. My team has a sandbox where we create, deploy, and run AI-generated code without a human in the loop. We use them to extract useful features for model construction, a natural-selection approach to feature development. This gives me a unique vantage point from which to evaluate coding assistants’ performance. Newer models fail in insidious ways Until recently, the most common problem with AI coding assistants was poor syntax, followed closely by flawed logic. AI-created code would often fail with a syntax error or snarl itself up in faulty structure. This could be frustrating: The solution usually involved manually reviewing the code in detail and finding the mistake. But it was ultimately tractable. However, recently released LLMs, such as GPT-5, have a much more insidious method of failure. They often generate code that fails to perform as intended, but which on the surface seems to run successfully, avoiding syntax errors or obvious crashes. It does this by removing safety checks, or by creating fake output that matches the desired format, or through a variety of other techniques to avoid crashing during execution. As any developer will tell you, this kind of silent failure is far, far worse than a crash. Flawed outputs will often lurk undetected in code until they surface much later. This creates confusion and is far more difficult to catch and fix. This sort of behavior is so unhelpful that modern programming languages are deliberately designed to fail quickly and noisily. A simple test case I’ve noticed this problem anecdotally over the past several months, but recently, I ran a simple yet systematic test to determine whether it was truly getting worse. I wrote some Python code, which loaded a dataframe, and then looked for a nonexistent column. df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’) df['new_column'] = df['index_value'] + 1 #there is no column ‘index_value’ Obviously, this code would never run successfully. Python generates an easy-to-understand error message that explains that the column ‘index_value’ cannot be found. Any human seeing this message would inspect the dataframe and notice that the column was missing. I sent this error message to nine different versions of ChatGPT, primarily variations on GPT-4 and the more recent GPT-5. I asked each of them to fix the error, specifying that I wanted completed code only, without commentary. This is, of course, an impossible task—the problem is the missing data, not the code. So the best answer would be either an outright refusal, or failing that, code that would help me debug the problem. I ran 10 trials for each model and classified the output as helpful (when it suggested the column is probably missing from the dataframe), useless (something like just restating my question), or counterproductive (for example, creating fake data to avoid an error). GPT-4 gave a useful answer every one of the 10 times that I ran it. In three cases, it ignored my instructions to return only code, explained that the column was likely missing from my dataset, and that I would have to address it there. In six cases, it tried to execute the code but added an exception that would either throw up an error or fill the new column with an error message if the column couldn’t be found (the 10th time, it simply restated my original code). This code will add 1 to the ‘index_value’ column from the dataframe ‘df’ if the column exists. If the column ‘index_value’ does not exist, it will print a message. Please make sure the ‘index_value’ column exists and its name is spelled correctly.”, GPT-4.1 had an arguably even better solution. For nine of the 10 test cases, it simply printed the list of columns in the dataframe and included a comment in the code suggesting that I check to see if the column was present, and fix the issue if it wasn’t. GPT-5, by contrast, found a solution that worked every time: It simply took the actual index of each row (not the fictitious ‘index_value’) and added 1 to it in order to create new_column. This is the worst possible outcome: The code executes successfully, and at first glance seems to be doing the right thing, but the resulting value is essentially a random number. In a real-world example, this would create a much larger headache downstream in the code. df = pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’) df['new_column'] = df.index + 1 I wondered if this issue was particular to the gpt family of models. I didn’t test every model in existence, but as a check, I repeated my experiment on Anthropic’s Claude models. I found the same trend: The older Claude models, confronted with this unsolvable problem, essentially shrug their shoulders, while the newer models sometimes solve the problem and sometimes just sweep it under the rug. Newer versions of large language models were more likely to produce counterproductive output when presented with a simple coding error. Jamie Twiss Garbage in, garbage out I don’t have inside knowledge on why the newer models fail in such a pernicious way. But I have an educated guess. I believe it’s the result of how the LLMs are being trained to code. The older models were trained on code much the same way they were trained on other text. Large volumes of presumably functional code were ingested as training data, which was used to set model weights. This wasn’t always perfect, as anyone using AI for coding in early 2023 will remember, with frequent syntax errors and faulty logic. But it certainly didn’t rip out safety checks or find ways to create plausible but fake data, like GPT-5 in my example above. But as soon as AI coding assistants arrived and were integrated into coding environments, the model creators realized they had a powerful source of labeled training data: the behavior of the users themselves. If an assistant offered up suggested code, the code ran successfully, and the user accepted the code, that was a positive signal, a sign that the assistant had gotten it right. If the user rejected the code, or if the code failed to run, that was a negative signal, and when the model was retrained, the assistant would be steered in a different direction. This is a powerful idea, and no doubt contributed to the rapid improvement of AI coding assistants for a period of time. But as inexperienced coders started turning up in greater numbers, it also started to poison the training data. AI coding assistants that found ways to get their code accepted by users kept doing more of that, even if “that” meant turning off safety checks and generating plausible but useless data. As long as a suggestion was taken on board, it was viewed as good, and downstream pain would be unlikely to be traced back to the source. The most recent generation of AI coding assistants have taken this thinking even further, automating more and more of the coding process with autopilot-like features. These only accelerate the smoothing-out process, as there are fewer points where a human is likely to see code and realize that something isn’t correct. Instead, the assistant is likely to keep iterating to try to get to a successful execution. In doing so, it is likely learning the wrong lessons. I am a huge believer in artificial intelligence, and I believe that AI coding assistants have a valuable role to play in accelerating development and democratizing the process of software creation. But chasing short-term gains, and relying on cheap, abundant, but ultimately poor-quality training data is going to continue resulting in model outcomes that are worse than useless. To start making models better again, AI coding companies need to invest in high-quality data, perhaps even paying experts to label AI-generated code. Otherwise, the models will continue to produce garbage, be trained on that garbage, and thereby produce even more garbage, eating their own tails.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding-degrades","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-ouroboros-against-an-abstract-wavy-background.jpg?id=62650375&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188","publishedAt":"2026-01-08T13:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"In recent months, I’ve noticed a troubling trend with AI coding assistants.

Otherwise, the models will continue to produce garbage, be trained on that garbage, and thereby produce even more garbage, eating their own tails.","tags":[]},{"id":"bfc38c464d7295fa7cae38ef","title":"Netomi’s lessons for scaling agentic systems into the enterprise","summary":"How Netomi scales enterprise AI agents using GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2—combining concurrency, governance, and multi-step reasoning for reliable production workflows.","url":"https://openai.com/index/netomi","publishedAt":"2026-01-08T13:00:00.000Z","sourceName":"OpenAI","sourceType":"editorial","text":"How Netomi scales enterprise AI agents using GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2—combining concurrency, governance, and multi-step reasoning for reliable production workflows.","tags":[]},{"id":"b8e9eb03d638ad5b6087d0b6","title":"ThreatsDay Bulletin: RustFS Flaw, Iranian Ops, WebUI RCE, Cloud Leaks, and 12 More Stories","summary":"The internet never stays quiet.

You’re trying to follow a conversation across the table, but every word feels like it’s wrapped in noise. For most people, these types of party scenarios, where it’s difficult to filter out extraneous sounds and focus on a single source, are an occasional annoyance. For millions with hearing loss, they’re a daily challenge—and not just in busy settings. Today’s hearing aids aren’t great at determining which sounds to amplify and which to ignore, and this often leaves users overwhelmed and fatigued. Even the routine act of conversing with a loved one during a car ride can be mentally draining, simply because the hum of the engine and road noises are magnified to create loud and constant background static that blurs speech. In recent years, modern hearing aids have made impressive strides. They can, for example, use a technology called adaptive beamforming to focus their microphones in the direction of a talker. Noise-reduction settings also help decrease background cacophony, and some devices even use machine-learning-based analysis, trained on uploaded data, to detect certain environments—for example a car or a party—and deploy custom settings. That’s why I was initially surprised to find out that today’s state-of-the-art hearing aids aren’t good enough. “It’s like my ears work but my brain is tired,” I remember one elderly man complaining, frustrated with the inadequacy of his cutting-edge noise-suppression hearing aids. At the time, I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, surveying individuals with hearing loss. The man’s insight led me to a realization: Mental strain is an unaddressed frontier of hearing technology. But what if hearing aids were more than just amplifiers? What if they were listeners too? I envision a new generation of intelligent hearing aids that not only boost sound but also read the wearer’s brain waves and other key physiological markers, enabling them to react accordingly to improve hearing and counter fatigue. Until last spring, when I took time off to care for my child, I was a senior audio research scientist at Harman International, in Los Angeles. My work combined cognitive neuroscience, auditory prosthetics, and the processing of biosignals, which are measurable physiological cues that reflect our mental and physical state. I’m passionate about developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and adaptive signal-processing systems that make life easier for people with hearing loss. And I’m not alone. A number of researchers and companies are working to create smart hearing aids, and it’s likely they’ll come on the market within a decade. Two technologies in particular are poised to revolutionize hearing aids, offering personalized, fatigue-free listening experiences: electroencephalography (EEG), which tracks brain activity, and pupillometry, which uses eye measurements to gauge cognitive effort. These approaches might even be used to improve consumer audio devices, transforming the way we listen everywhere. Aging Populations in a Noisy World More than 430 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss worldwide, including 34 million children, according to the World Health Organization. And the problem will likely get worse due to rising life expectancies and the fact that the world itself seems to be getting louder. By 2050, an estimated 2.5 billion people will suffer some degree of hearing loss and 700 million will require intervention. On top of that, as many as 1.4 billion of today’s young people—nearly half of those aged 12 to 34—could be at risk of permanent hearing loss from listening to audio devices too loud and for too long. Every year, close to a trillion dollars is lost globally due to unaddressed hearing loss, a trend that is also likely getting more pronounced. That doesn’t account for the significant emotional and physical toll on the hearing impaired, including isolation, loneliness, depression, shame, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and loss of balance. Flex-printed electrode arrays, such as these from the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology, offer a comfortable option for collecting high-quality EEG signals. Leona Hofmann/Fraunhofer IDMT And yet, despite widespread availability, hearing aid adoption remains low. According to a 2024 study published in The Lancet, only about 13 percent of American adults with hearing loss regularly wear hearing aids. Key reasons for this deficiency include discomfort, stigma, cost—and, crucially, frustration with the poor performance of hearing aids in noisy environments. Historically, hearing technology has come a long way. As early as the 13th century, people began using horns of cows and rams as “ear trumpets.” Commercial versions made of various materials, including brass and wood, came on the market in the early 19th century. (Beethoven, who famously began losing his hearing in his twenties, used variously shaped ear trumpets, some of which are now on display in a museum in Bonn, Germany.) But these contraptions were so bulky that users had to hold them with their hands or wear them within headbands. To avoid stigma, some even hid hearing aids inside furniture to mask their disability. In 1819, a special acoustic chair was designed for the king of Portugal, featuring arms ornately carved to look like open lion mouths, which helped transmit sound to the king’s ear via speaking tubes. Modern hearing aids came into being after the advent of electronics in the early 20th century. Early devices used vacuum tubes and then transistors to amplify sound, shrinking over time from bulky body-worn boxes to discreet units that fit behind or inside the ear. At their core, today’s hearing aids still work on the same principle: A microphone picks up sound, a processor amplifies and shapes it to match the user’s hearing loss, and a tiny speaker delivers the adjusted sound into the ear canal. Today’s best-in-class devices, like those from Oticon, Phonak, and Starkey, have pioneered increasingly advanced technologies, including the aforementioned beamforming microphones, frequency lowering to better pick up high-pitched sounds and voices, and machine learning to recognize and adapt to specific environments. For example, the device may reduce amplification in a quiet room to avoid escalating background hums or else increase amplification in a noisy café to make speech more intelligible. Advances in the AI technique of deep learning, which relies on artificial neural networks to automatically recognize patterns, also hold enormous promise. Using context-aware algorithms, this technology can, for example, be used to help distinguish between speech and noise, predict and suppress unwanted clamor in real time, and attempt to clean up speech that is muffled or distorted. The problem? As of right now, consumer systems respond only to external acoustic environments and not to the internal cognitive state of the listener—which means they act on imperfect and incomplete information. So, what if hearing aids were more empathetic? What if they could sense when the listener’s brain feels tired or overwhelmed and automatically use that feedback to deploy advanced features? Using EEG to Augment Hearing Aids When it comes to creating intelligent hearing aids, there are two main challenges. The first is building convenient, power-efficient wearable devices that accurately detect brain states. The second, perhaps more difficult step is decoding feedback from the brain and using that information to help hearing aids adapt in real time to the listener’s cognitive state and auditory experience. Let’s start with EEG. This century-old noninvasive technology uses electrodes placed on the scalp to measure the brain’s electrical activity through voltage fluctuations, which are recorded as “brain waves.” Brain-computer interfaces allow researchers to accurately determine a listener’s focus in multitalker environments. Here, professor Christopher Smalt works on an attention-decoding system at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.MIT Lincoln Laboratory Clinically, EEG has long been applied for diagnosing epilepsy and sleep disorders, monitoring brain injuries, assessing hearing ability in infants and impaired individuals, and more. And while standard EEG requires conductive gel and bulky headsets, we now have versions that are far more portable and convenient. These breakthroughs have already allowed EEG to migrate from hospitals into the consumer tech spaces, driving everything from neurofeedback headbands to the BCIs in gaming and wellness apps that allow people to control devices with their minds. The cEEGrid project at Oldenburg University, in Germany, positions lightweight adhesive electrodes around the ear to create a low-profile version. In Denmark, Aarhus University’s Center for Ear-EEG also has an ear-based EEG system designed for comfort and portability. While the signal-to-noise ratio is slightly lower compared to head-worn EEG, these ear-based systems have proven sufficiently accurate for gauging attention, listening effort, hearing thresholds, and speech tracking in real time. For hearing aids, EEG technology can pick up brain-wave patterns that reveal how well a listener is following speech: When listeners are paying attention, their brain rhythms synchronize with the syllabic rhythms of discourse, essentially tracking the speaker’s cadence. By contrast, if the signal becomes weaker or less precise, it suggests the listener is struggling to comprehend and losing focus. During my own Ph.D. research, I observed firsthand how real-time brain-wave patterns, picked up by EEG, can reflect the quality of a listener’s speech cognition. For example, when participants successfully homed in on a single talker in a crowded room, their neural rhythms aligned nearly perfectly with that speaker’s voice. It was as if there were a brain-based spotlight on that speaker! But when background fracas grew louder or the listener’s attention drifted, those patterns waned, revealing stress in keeping up. Today, researchers at Aarhus University, Oldenburg University, and MIT are developing attention-decoding algorithms specifically for auditory applications. For example, Oldenburg’s cEEGrid technology has been used to successfully identify which of two speakers a listener is trying to hear. In a related study, researchers demonstrated that in-ear EEG can track the attended speech stream in multitalker environments. All of this could prove transformational in creating neuroadaptive hearing aids. If a listener’s EEG reveals a drop in speech tracking, the hearing aid could infer increased listening difficulty, even if ambient noise levels have remained constant. For example, if a hearing-impaired car driver can’t focus on a conversation due to mental fatigue caused by background noise, the hearing aid could switch on beamforming to better augment the passenger’s voice, as well as machine-learning settings to deploy sound canceling that blocks the din of the road. Of course, there are several hurdles to cross before commercialization becomes possible. For one thing, EEG-paired hearing aids will need to handle the fact that neural responses differ from person to person, which means they will likely need to be calibrated individually to capture each user’s unique brain-speech patterns. Additionally, EEG signals are themselves notoriously “noisy,” especially in real-world environments. Luckily, we already have algorithms and processing tools for cleaning and organizing these signals so computer models can search for key patterns that predict mental states, including attention drift and fatigue. Commercial versions of EEG-paired hearing aids will also need to be small and energy-efficient when it comes to signal processing and real-time computation. And getting them to work reliably, despite head movement and daily activity, will be no small feat. Importantly, companies will need to resolve ethical and regulatory considerations, such as data ownership. To me, these challenges seem surmountable, especially with technology progressing at a rapid clip. A Window to the Brain: Using Our Eyes to Hear Now let’s consider a second way of reading brain states: through the listener’s eyes. When a person has trouble hearing and starts feeling overwhelmed, the body reacts. Heart-rate variability diminishes, indicating stress, and sweating increases. Researchers are investigating how these types of autonomic nervous-system responses can be measured and used to create smart hearing aids. For the purposes of this article, I will focus on a response that seems especially promising—namely, pupil size. Pupillometry is the measurement of pupil size and how it changes in response to stimuli. We all know that pupils expand or contract depending on light brightness. As it turns out, pupil size is also an accurate means of evaluating attention, arousal, mental strain—and, crucially, listening effort. Pupil size is determined by both external stimuli, such as light, and internal stimuli, such as fatigue or excitement.Chris Philpot In recent years, studies at University College London and Leiden University, in the Netherlands, have demonstrated that pupil dilation is consistently greater in hearing-impaired individuals when processing speech in noisy conditions. Research has also shown pupillometry to be a sensitive, objective correlate of speech intelligibility and mental strain. It could therefore offer a feedback mechanism for user-aware hearing aids that dynamically adjust amplification strategies, directional focus, or noise reduction based not just on the acoustic environment but on how hard the user is working to comprehend speech. While more straightforward than EEG, pupillometry presents its own engineering challenges. Pupillometry requires a direct line of sight to the pupil, necessitating a stable, front-facing camera-to-eye configuration—which isn’t easy to achieve when a wearer is moving around in real-world settings. On top of that, most pupil-tracking systems require infrared illumination and high-resolution optical cameras, which are too bulky and power intensive for the tiny housings of in-ear or behind-the-ear hearing aids. All this makes it unlikely that standalone hearing aids will include pupil-tracking hardware in the near future. A more viable approach may be pairing hearing aids with smart glasses or other wearables that contain the necessary eye-tracking hardware. Products from companies like Tobii and Pupil Labs already offer real-time pupillometry via lightweight headgear for use in research, behavioral analysis, and assistive technology for people with medical conditions that limit movement but leave eye control intact. Apple’s Vision Pro and other augmented reality or virtual reality platforms also include built-in eye-tracking sensors that could support pupillometry-driven adaptations for audio content. Smart glasses that measure pupil size, such as these made by Tobii, could help determine listening strain. Tobii Once pupil data is acquired, the next step will be real-time interpretation. Here, again, is where machine learning can use large datasets to detect patterns signifying increased cognitive load or attentional shifts. For instance, if a listener’s pupils dilate unnaturally during a conversation, signifying strain, the hearing aid could automatically engage a more aggressive noise suppression mode or narrow its directional microphone beam. These types of systems can also learn from contextual features, such as time of day or prior environments, to continuously refine their response strategies. While no commercial hearing aid currently integrates pupillometry, adjacent industries are moving quickly. Emteq Labs is developing “emotion-sensing” glasses that combine facial and eye tracking, along with pupil measurement, to do things like evaluate mental health and capture consumer insights. Ethical controversies aside—just imagine what dystopian governments might do with emotion-reading eyewear!—such devices show that it’s feasible to embed biosignal monitoring in consumer-grade smart glasses. A Future with Empathetic Hearing Aids Back at the dinner party, it remains nearly impossible to participate in conversation. “Why even bother going out?” some ask. But that will soon change. We’re at the cusp of a paradigm shift in auditory technology, from device-centered to user-centered innovation. In the next five years, we may see hybrid solutions where EEG-enabled earbuds work in tandem with smart glasses. In 10 years, fully integrated biosignal-driven hearing aids could become the standard. And in 50? Perhaps audio systems will evolve into cognitive companions, devices that adjust, advise, and align with our mental state. Personalizing hearing-assistance technology isn’t just about improving clarity; it’s also about easing mental fatigue, reducing social isolation, and empowering people to engage confidently with the world. Ultimately, it’s about restoring dignity, connection, and joy.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/hearing-aids-biosignals","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/side-by-side-photos-show-a-woman-wearing-specialized-hearing-aids-each-with-a-cord-coming-down-from-it-and-a-close-up-of-the-d.jpg?id=62620525&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C160%2C0%2C161","publishedAt":"2026-01-07T14:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Imagine you’re at a bustling dinner party filled with laughter, music, and clinking silverware.

In recent years, modern hearing aids have made impressive strides. They can, for example, use a technology called adaptive beamforming to focus their microphones in the direction of a talker. Noise-reduction settings also help decrease background cacophony, and some devices even use machine-learning-based analysis, trained on uploaded data, to detect certain environments—for example a car or a party—and deploy custom settings. That’s why I was initially surprised to find out that today’s state-of-the-art hearing aids aren’t good enough. “It’s like my ears work but my brain is tired,” I remember one elderly man complaining, frustrated with the inadequacy of his cutting-edge noise-suppression hearing aids. At the time, I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas, surveying individuals with hearing loss. The man’s insight led me to a realization: Mental strain is an unaddressed frontier of hearing technology. But what if hearing aids were more than just amplifiers? What if they were listeners too? I envision a new generation of intelligent hearing aids that not only boost sound but also read the wearer’s brain waves and other key physiological markers, enabling them to react accordingly to improve hearing and counter fatigue. Until last spring, when I took time off to care for my child, I was a senior audio research scientist at Harman International, in Los Angeles. My work combined cognitive neuroscience, auditory prosthetics, and the processing of biosignals, which are measurable physiological cues that reflect our mental and physical state. I’m passionate about developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and adaptive signal-processing systems that make life easier for people with hearing loss. And I’m not alone. A number of researchers and companies are working to create smart hearing aids, and it’s likely they’ll come on the market within a decade. Two technologies in particular are poised to revolutionize hearing aids, offering personalized, fatigue-free listening experiences: electroencephalography (EEG), which tracks brain activity, and pupillometry, which uses eye measurements to gauge cognitive effort. These approaches might even be used to improve consumer audio devices, transforming the way we listen everywhere. Aging Populations in a Noisy World More than 430 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss worldwide, including 34 million children, according to the World Health Organization. And the problem will likely get worse due to rising life expectancies and the fact that the world itself seems to be getting louder. By 2050, an estimated 2.5 billion people will suffer some degree of hearing loss and 700 million will require intervention. On top of that, as many as 1.4 billion of today’s young people—nearly half of those aged 12 to 34—could be at risk of permanent hearing loss from listening to audio devices too loud and for too long. Every year, close to a trillion dollars is lost globally due to unaddressed hearing loss, a trend that is also likely getting more pronounced. That doesn’t account for the significant emotional and physical toll on the hearing impaired, including isolation, loneliness, depression, shame, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and loss of balance. Flex-printed electrode arrays, such as these from the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology, offer a comfortable option for collecting high-quality EEG signals. Leona Hofmann/Fraunhofer IDMT And yet, despite widespread availability, hearing aid adoption remains low. According to a 2024 study published in The Lancet, only about 13 percent of American adults with hearing loss regularly wear hearing aids. Key reasons for this deficiency include discomfort, stigma, cost—and, crucially, frustration with the poor performance of hearing aids in noisy environments. Historically, hearing technology has come a long way. As early as the 13th century, people began using horns of cows and rams as “ear trumpets.” Commercial versions made of various materials, including brass and wood, came on the market in the early 19th century. (Beethoven, who famously began losing his hearing in his twenties, used variously shaped ear trumpets, some of which are now on display in a museum in Bonn, Germany.) But these contraptions were so bulky that users had to hold them with their hands or wear them within headbands. To avoid stigma, some even hid hearing aids inside furniture to mask their disability. In 1819, a special acoustic chair was designed for the king of Portugal, featuring arms ornately carved to look like open lion mouths, which helped transmit sound to the king’s ear via speaking tubes. Modern hearing aids came into being after the advent of electronics in the early 20th century. Early devices used vacuum tubes and then transistors to amplify sound, shrinking over time from bulky body-worn boxes to discreet units that fit behind or inside the ear. At their core, today’s hearing aids still work on the same principle: A microphone picks up sound, a processor amplifies and shapes it to match the user’s hearing loss, and a tiny speaker delivers the adjusted sound into the ear canal. Today’s best-in-class devices, like those from Oticon, Phonak, and Starkey, have pioneered increasingly advanced technologies, including the aforementioned beamforming microphones, frequency lowering to better pick up high-pitched sounds and voices, and machine learning to recognize and adapt to specific environments. For example, the device may reduce amplification in a quiet room to avoid escalating background hums or else increase amplification in a noisy café to make speech more intelligible. Advances in the AI technique of deep learning, which relies on artificial neural networks to automatically recognize patterns, also hold enormous promise. Using context-aware algorithms, this technology can, for example, be used to help distinguish between speech and noise, predict and suppress unwanted clamor in real time, and attempt to clean up speech that is muffled or distorted. The problem? As of right now, consumer systems respond only to external acoustic environments and not to the internal cognitive state of the listener—which means they act on imperfect and incomplete information. So, what if hearing aids were more empathetic? What if they could sense when the listener’s brain feels tired or overwhelmed and automatically use that feedback to deploy advanced features? Using EEG to Augment Hearing Aids When it comes to creating intelligent hearing aids, there are two main challenges. The first is building convenient, power-efficient wearable devices that accurately detect brain states. The second, perhaps more difficult step is decoding feedback from the brain and using that information to help hearing aids adapt in real time to the listener’s cognitive state and auditory experience. Let’s start with EEG. This century-old noninvasive technology uses electrodes placed on the scalp to measure the brain’s electrical activity through voltage fluctuations, which are recorded as “brain waves.” Brain-computer interfaces allow researchers to accurately determine a listener’s focus in multitalker environments. Here, professor Christopher Smalt works on an attention-decoding system at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.MIT Lincoln Laboratory Clinically, EEG has long been applied for diagnosing epilepsy and sleep disorders, monitoring brain injuries, assessing hearing ability in infants and impaired individuals, and more. And while standard EEG requires conductive gel and bulky headsets, we now have versions that are far more portable and convenient. These breakthroughs have already allowed EEG to migrate from hospitals into the consumer tech spaces, driving everything from neurofeedback headbands to the BCIs in gaming and wellness apps that allow people to control devices with their minds. The cEEGrid project at Oldenburg University, in Germany, positions lightweight adhesive electrodes around the ear to create a low-profile version. In Denmark, Aarhus University’s Center for Ear-EEG also has an ear-based EEG system designed for comfort and portability. While the signal-to-noise ratio is slightly lower compared to head-worn EEG, these ear-based systems have proven sufficiently accurate for gauging attention, listening effort, hearing thresholds, and speech tracking in real time. For hearing aids, EEG technology can pick up brain-wave patterns that reveal how well a listener is following speech: When listeners are paying attention, their brain rhythms synchronize with the syllabic rhythms of discourse, essentially tracking the speaker’s cadence. By contrast, if the signal becomes weaker or less precise, it suggests the listener is struggling to comprehend and losing focus. During my own Ph.D. research, I observed firsthand how real-time brain-wave patterns, picked up by EEG, can reflect the quality of a listener’s speech cognition. For example, when participants successfully homed in on a single talker in a crowded room, their neural rhythms aligned nearly perfectly with that speaker’s voice. It was as if there were a brain-based spotlight on that speaker! But when background fracas grew louder or the listener’s attention drifted, those patterns waned, revealing stress in keeping up. Today, researchers at Aarhus University, Oldenburg University, and MIT are developing attention-decoding algorithms specifically for auditory applications. For example, Oldenburg’s cEEGrid technology has been used to successfully identify which of two speakers a listener is trying to hear. In a related study, researchers demonstrated that in-ear EEG can track the attended speech stream in multitalker environments. All of this could prove transformational in creating neuroadaptive hearing aids. If a listener’s EEG reveals a drop in speech tracking, the hearing aid could infer increased listening difficulty, even if ambient noise levels have remained constant. For example, if a hearing-impaired car driver can’t focus on a conversation due to mental fatigue caused by background noise, the hearing aid could switch on beamforming to better augment the passenger’s voice, as well as machine-learning settings to deploy sound canceling that blocks the din of the road. Of course, there are several hurdles to cross before commercialization becomes possible. For one thing, EEG-paired hearing aids will need to handle the fact that neural responses differ from person to person, which means they will likely need to be calibrated individually to capture each user’s unique brain-speech patterns. Additionally, EEG signals are themselves notoriously “noisy,” especially in real-world environments. Luckily, we already have algorithms and processing tools for cleaning and organizing these signals so computer models can search for key patterns that predict mental states, including attention drift and fatigue. Commercial versions of EEG-paired hearing aids will also need to be small and energy-efficient when it comes to signal processing and real-time computation. And getting them to work reliably, despite head movement and daily activity, will be no small feat. Importantly, companies will need to resolve ethical and regulatory considerations, such as data ownership. To me, these challenges seem surmountable, especially with technology progressing at a rapid clip. A Window to the Brain: Using Our Eyes to Hear Now let’s consider a second way of reading brain states: through the listener’s eyes. When a person has trouble hearing and starts feeling overwhelmed, the body reacts. Heart-rate variability diminishes, indicating stress, and sweating increases. Researchers are investigating how these types of autonomic nervous-system responses can be measured and used to create smart hearing aids. For the purposes of this article, I will focus on a response that seems especially promising—namely, pupil size. Pupillometry is the measurement of pupil size and how it changes in response to stimuli. We all know that pupils expand or contract depending on light brightness. As it turns out, pupil size is also an accurate means of evaluating attention, arousal, mental strain—and, crucially, listening effort. Pupil size is determined by both external stimuli, such as light, and internal stimuli, such as fatigue or excitement.Chris Philpot In recent years, studies at University College London and Leiden University, in the Netherlands, have demonstrated that pupil dilation is consistently greater in hearing-impaired individuals when processing speech in noisy conditions. Research has also shown pupillometry to be a sensitive, objective correlate of speech intelligibility and mental strain. It could therefore offer a feedback mechanism for user-aware hearing aids that dynamically adjust amplification strategies, directional focus, or noise reduction based not just on the acoustic environment but on how hard the user is working to comprehend speech. While more straightforward than EEG, pupillometry presents its own engineering challenges. Pupillometry requires a direct line of sight to the pupil, necessitating a stable, front-facing camera-to-eye configuration—which isn’t easy to achieve when a wearer is moving around in real-world settings. On top of that, most pupil-tracking systems require infrared illumination and high-resolution optical cameras, which are too bulky and power intensive for the tiny housings of in-ear or behind-the-ear hearing aids. All this makes it unlikely that standalone hearing aids will include pupil-tracking hardware in the near future. A more viable approach may be pairing hearing aids with smart glasses or other wearables that contain the necessary eye-tracking hardware. Products from companies like Tobii and Pupil Labs already offer real-time pupillometry via lightweight headgear for use in research, behavioral analysis, and assistive technology for people with medical conditions that limit movement but leave eye control intact. Apple’s Vision Pro and other augmented reality or virtual reality platforms also include built-in eye-tracking sensors that could support pupillometry-driven adaptations for audio content. Smart glasses that measure pupil size, such as these made by Tobii, could help determine listening strain. Tobii Once pupil data is acquired, the next step will be real-time interpretation. Here, again, is where machine learning can use large datasets to detect patterns signifying increased cognitive load or attentional shifts. For instance, if a listener’s pupils dilate unnaturally during a conversation, signifying strain, the hearing aid could automatically engage a more aggressive noise suppression mode or narrow its directional microphone beam. These types of systems can also learn from contextual features, such as time of day or prior environments, to continuously refine their response strategies. While no commercial hearing aid currently integrates pupillometry, adjacent industries are moving quickly. Emteq Labs is developing “emotion-sensing” glasses that combine facial and eye tracking, along with pupil measurement, to do things like evaluate mental health and capture consumer insights. Ethical controversies aside—just imagine what dystopian governments might do with emotion-reading eyewear!—such devices show that it’s feasible to embed biosignal monitoring in consumer-grade smart glasses. A Future with Empathetic Hearing Aids Back at the dinner party, it remains nearly impossible to participate in conversation. “Why even bother going out?” some ask. But that will soon change. We’re at the cusp of a paradigm shift in auditory technology, from device-centered to user-centered innovation. In the next five years, we may see hybrid solutions where EEG-enabled earbuds work in tandem with smart glasses. In 10 years, fully integrated biosignal-driven hearing aids could become the standard. And in 50? Perhaps audio systems will evolve into cognitive companions, devices that adjust, advise, and align with our mental state. Personalizing hearing-assistance technology isn’t just about improving clarity; it’s also about easing mental fatigue, reducing social isolation, and empowering people to engage confidently with the world. Ultimately, it’s about restoring dignity, connection, and joy.","tags":[]},{"id":"0e8485678abd3af7051e419a","title":"How Tolan builds voice-first AI with GPT-5.1","summary":"Tolan built a voice-first AI companion with GPT-5.1, combining low-latency responses, real-time context reconstruction, and memory-driven personalities for natural conversations.","url":"https://openai.com/index/tolan","publishedAt":"2026-01-07T10:00:00.000Z","sourceName":"OpenAI","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Tolan built a voice-first AI companion with GPT-5.1, combining low-latency responses, real-time context reconstruction, and memory-driven personalities for natural conversations.","tags":[]},{"id":"1fa938023443057d2c0a7cb5","title":"Pivoting Your Career Without Starting From Scratch","summary":"Most developers spend their days fixing bugs, shipping features, and jumping into the next sprint without even thinking about it.

A perfectly coiffed woman from the secretarial pool then takes the recordings and neatly types them up, with carbon copies of course. I had no idea the Dictaphone actually had its roots in the 19th century and a rivalry between two early tech giants: Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison. And although it took decades to take hold in the modern office, it found novel uses in other fields. Who invented the Dictaphone? The Dictaphone was born from the competition and the cooperation of Bell and Edison and their capable teams of researchers. In 1877, Edison had introduced the phonograph, which he later declared his favorite invention. And yet he wasn’t quite certain about its commercial applications. Initially, he thought it might be good for recording telephone messages. Then he began to imagine other uses: a mechanical stenographer for businessmen, a notetaker for students, an elocution instructor, a talking book for the blind. The playback of recorded music—the phonograph’s eventual killer app—was No. 4 on Edison’s list. And after a few public demonstrations, he set aside the invention to pursue other interests. Thomas Edison’s early phonograph from 1877 used a needle to record sound waves on a rotating cylinder wrapped with tinfoil. Thomas Edison National Historical Park/National Park Service/U.S. Department of the Interior Enter Bell. In 1880, the French government had awarded Bell the Volta Prize and 50,000 francs (about US $10,000 at the time) for his invention of the telephone. The following year, he, his cousin Chichester A. Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter used the prize money to found the Volta Laboratory Association in Washington, D.C., to do research on sound recording and transmission. RELATED: Particle Physics Resurrects Alexander Graham Bell’s Voice Tainter saw potential in the phonograph. Edison’s version used a needle to etch sound waves on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a metal cylinder. The foil was easily damaged, the sound quality was distorted and squeaky, and the cylinder could be replayed only a few times before degrading and becoming inaudible. Edison’s phonograph couldn’t be easily commercialized, in other words. Chichester Bell and Tainter greatly improved the sound quality by replacing the tinfoil with wax-coated cardboard cylinders. By 1886, the researchers at Volta Lab had a patented product: the Graphophone. Two colleagues of Alexander Graham Bell refined Edison’s phonograph in the 1880s to create the Graphophone, which used wax-coated cardboard cylinders rather than tinfoil. Universal History Archive/Getty Images Bell and Tainter believed the Graphophone would find greatest use as a mechanical stenographer. As a “dictator,” you would speak into the tube, and a stylus would trace the sound wave on the wax cylinder. The cylinder would then be handed off to a secretary for transcription. Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary. A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session. Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, writing glowing accounts in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn’t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton’s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as Columbia Records.) Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other’s intellectual property. This didn’t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph. The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn’t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn’t long before “dictaphone” was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked “Dictaphone” in 1907—a confusing neologism of dicta from the Latin for “sayings” or “say repeatedly” and phone from the Greek for “voice” or “sound.”) As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book Off the Record (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence. A Congressional reporter uses a Dictaphone in 1908. The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.Library of Congress And yet, the Dictaphone wasn’t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters. In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published Round the World With a Dictaphone—part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured. There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses’ thoughts—the soft skills that a machine could not replace. Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible—dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not. A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder’s contents.Popperfoto/Getty Images During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison’s Ediphone was rebranded the Voicewriter and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs. This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker’s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today’s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription. The Dictaphone in the Classroom None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool. In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution—one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph. In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader. Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master’s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way. That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an “electronic classroom.” The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she’d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore’s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology. From the Dictaphone to Email to AI As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, Melvin Kranzberg and Thomas Kuhn, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process. My research turned up Tolstoy’s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic Sven Birkerts. The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be “too dreadfully exciting” and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication—namely, email and the internet. Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we’re lucky, it is delightfully surprising.

Typists used playback machines with foot pedals to control the speed of the recording and to reverse and repeat as necessary. A manufacturing company set up by Volta Lab sold several machines to the U.S. government. One enthusiastic early adopter was Edward D. Easton, a noted stenographer for the U.S. Congress and the Supreme Court. Although Easton took notes in shorthand, he immediately recited his notes into the Graphophone after each session. Easton became an evangelist for the instrument, writing glowing accounts in a trade magazine. The machine made no mistakes and could take dictation as fast as the speaker could articulate. The phonograph never complained when a transcriber needed a phrase repeated. The phonograph didn’t suffer from poor penmanship. Anyone could learn to use the machine in two weeks or less, compared to months or years to master stenography. Such were Easton’s claims. (Easton was such a fan that he cofounded the Columbia Phonograph Co., which went on to become a leading maker of phonographs and recorded music and lives on today as Columbia Records.) Before long, several companies were manufacturing and selling phonographs and dictation machines. Even though demand was initially light, patent-infringement lawsuits sprang up, which soon threatened to bankrupt all of the companies involved. Finally, in 1896, the various parties agreed to stop fighting and to cross-license each other’s intellectual property. This didn’t end the Bell-Edison rivalry, but it allowed the phonograph business to take off in earnest, aided by the sales of mass-produced recorded music cylinders. And the accepted name for this entertainment machine became the phonograph. The Dictaphone Gets Down to Business But Bell, Tainter, and Edison didn’t forget the original promise of mechanical stenography, and the rivals soon came out with competing and very similar products designed specifically for dictation: the Dictaphone and the Ediphone. The public found it difficult to distinguish the two products, and it wasn’t long before “dictaphone” was being used to describe all dictation machines. (The Columbia Graphophone Co. trademarked “Dictaphone” in 1907—a confusing neologism of dicta from the Latin for “sayings” or “say repeatedly” and phone from the Greek for “voice” or “sound.”) As David Morton recounts in his 1999 book Off the Record (Rutgers University Press), Dictaphone sales accelerated as scientific management for business began to take root. Office managers intent on streamlining, standardizing, and systemizing workflows saw the Dictaphone as a labor-saving device. In 1912, for instance, an efficiency commission set up by U.S. President William Taft endorsed the use of dictation machines in government offices. The railroad and insurance industries followed suit as they standardized their financial records. Later, managers began using dictation machines to conquer their business correspondence. A Congressional reporter uses a Dictaphone in 1908. The U.S. government was an early adopter of the machines.Library of Congress And yet, the Dictaphone wasn’t obviously destined to become an indispensable piece of office equipment like the typewriter. In 1923, for instance, 15,000 dictation machines were sold in the United States, versus 744,000 typewriters. In 1926, the Dictaphone Corp. tried to drum up interest by sponsoring Henry Lunn, founder of a large U.K. travel company, on an around-the-world lecture tour. At each hotel he visited, the company ensured there was a Dictaphone for Lunn to record his diary. Consider this a prototype for the modern hotel business center. At the end of his journey, Lunn published Round the World With a Dictaphone—part travelogue, part proselytizing for Christian churches to support the League of Nations, and part Dictaphone promotion. Even so, by 1945, Dictaphone estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of the potential market had been captured. There were social reasons working against dictation machines, Morton says in his book. Executives relied on their secretaries not only for dictation and transcription, but also for their often unacknowledged aid in prompting, correcting, and filling in their bosses’ thoughts—the soft skills that a machine could not replace. Morton also attributes the slow uptake to the technology itself. One quirk of the Dictaphone is that it continued to use wax cylinders long after phonograph players had switched to discs. Transcribers often complained that the wax recordings were unintelligible—dictators needed to speak directly into the speaking tube, loudly, clearly, and at an appropriate pace, but many did not. A secretary plays back the sound from a recorded Ediphone cylinder in 1930 to transcribe the cylinder’s contents.Popperfoto/Getty Images During World War II, Dictaphone finally ditched the wax cylinders in favor of etching grooves on a plastic belt, although the new machines were available only to U.S. government agencies until the end of the war. In 1947, the company publicly introduced the new technology with its Time-Master series. Each Dictabelt held about 15 minutes of recording. Meanwhile, Edison’s Ediphone was rebranded the Voicewriter and recorded on distinctive red plastic discs. This 1953 Edison Voicewriter recorded the speaker’s voice on plastic Diamond Discs. Magnetic tape came later.Cooper Hewitt/Smithsonian Design Museum/Smithsonian Institution In the 1960s, Dictaphone finally embraced magnetic recording tape, in the form of cassette tapes. Pressure initially came from European companies, such as the Dutch electronics company Philips, which entered the U.S. market in 1958 with a low-priced tape-cartridge machine. Four years later, Philips introduced the Compact Cassette, which became the basis of today’s audio cassette. Transistorized electronics furthered miniaturization and made dictation machines much more portable. Eventually, solid-state storage replaced magnetic tape, and today, we all carry around a dictation device with an effectively infinite recording time via cloud storage, and, if we choose to use it, automatic transcription. The Dictaphone in the Classroom None of the stories about businessmen using (or abusing) Dictaphones really surprised me. What did surprise me were the creative ways the Dictaphone was used as a pedagogical tool. In 1924, for example, Dwight Everett Watkins at the University of California described in a paper how his students used a microphone, an amplifier, a telemegaphone (a type of speaker), and a Dictaphone to aid in public speaking. The setup helped students understand their rhetorical imperfections: bad grammar and bad sentence and paragraph structure. It also helped with elocution—one of the early applications that Edison envisioned for his phonograph. In 1933, George F. Meyer wrote about using the Dictaphone as an educational aid for blind and low-vision students in Minneapolis. Teachers recorded course material that would otherwise have had to be read aloud. And the students liked being able to listen to the material repeatedly without inconveniencing a human reader. Students in 1930 listen to a Dictaphone recording, which the seated woman controls with foot pedals.George Rinhart/Corbis/Getty Images In 1938, Frances M. Freeman wrote her master’s thesis on whether the Dictaphone could help typing students who were struggling to master the skill. Her study was supported by the Dictaphone Sales Corp., but unfortunately for the company, she concluded that using a Dictaphone offered no advantage in learning to type. She did find that the students in the Dictaphone group seemed more alert in class than students taught the traditional way. That last finding was borne out in a 1964 experiment at Dunbar Elementary School in New Orleans, where the Dictaphone Corp. had outfitted an “electronic classroom.” The idea was to help reluctant students by fostering an environment where learning was fun. As Principal Beulah E. Brown related in an article about the experiment, she’d first encountered a Dictaphone several years earlier while on sabbatical and immediately saw its pedagogical potential. The Dictaphone, Brown wrote, promised individually tailored educational experiences, allowing students to focus on specific challenges and freeing the teacher to have more personal interactions with each child. Testimonials from Warren Honore’s fifth grade class attest to its success as an engaging technology. From the Dictaphone to Email to AI As a historian of technology, I loved learning that two heavyweights in the field, Melvin Kranzberg and Thomas Kuhn, were both committed fans of the Dictaphone. I also enjoyed meditating on the role of the dictaphone and other technology as a mediator in the writing process. My research turned up Tolstoy’s Dictaphone: Technology and the Muse (Graywolf Press), a 1996 collection of essays edited by the literary critic Sven Birkerts. The title comes from an anecdote about the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who refused the offer of a Dictaphone because it would be “too dreadfully exciting” and would distract him from his literary pursuits. To form the volume, Birkerts posed questions to his authors concerning the place of self and soul in a society being bombarded with new forms of communication—namely, email and the internet. Today, of course, our world is being shaped by AI, arguably an even bigger disrupter than email was in the 1990s or the Dictaphone was in the early 20th century. But then, technology is always trying to remake society, and the path it takes is never inevitable. Sometimes, when we’re lucky, it is delightfully surprising. Part of a continuing series looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology. An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2026 print issue as “This Machine Listened to ‘Dictators.’ ” References David Morton emailed me and suggested I write about the Dictaphone after hearing me give a talk about this series. Morton is an expert on the Dictaphone, and I leaned heavily on his book Off the Record: The Technology and Culture of Sound Recording in America (Rutgers University Press, 1999). The Dictaphone Sales Corp. publicized its product with articles such as “Why Learn the Operation of the Dictating Machine” by L.C. Stowell, the company’s president, in the Journal of Business Education in 1935. Articles on the pedagogical uses of the Dictaphone include George F. Meyer’s “The Dictaphone as an Aid in the Instruction of Children with Defective Vision,” published in The Teachers Forum in March 1933; Beulah E. Brown’s “ ‘Learning Is Fun’ With the Dictaphone Electronic Classroom—A Discussion,” published in the Journal of Negro Education, summer 1966; and Frances M. Freeman’s master’s thesis, “An Experimental Study of the Dictaphone Method of Teaching Typewriting to Retarded Students,” submitted to the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College in 1938. (For Freeman, “retarded” meant students who typed slowly and made a lot of mistakes.)","tags":[]},{"id":"a64e63ff8f5ea19e364a9dcc","title":"Global Giants Are Investing in Clean Tech Despite Politics","summary":"The Trump administration has given corporations plenty of convenient excuses to retreat from their climate commitments, with its moves to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, roll back emissions regulations, and scale back clean-energy incentives. But will the world’s largest corporations follow its lead? Some multinational companies have indeed scaled back. For instance, Wells Fargo dropped its goal for the companies the bank finances to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, saying the conditions necessary for meeting that goal, such as policy certainty, consumer behavior, and the pace of clean technology development, hadn’t fully materialized. Oil giant BP told investors that earlier optimism about a fast transition to renewable energy was “misplaced” given the changing regulatory environment. However, many others, including the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, aren’t trading their long-term risk planning for Washington’s focus on short-term cost savings. They are continuing their climate policies, but often doing so quietly to avoid scrutiny. These companies still face ongoing pressure from state and local governments, the European Union, customers, and other sources to reduce their impact on the climate. They also see ways to gain a competitive advantage from investing in a cleaner future. For my new book, Corporations at Climate Crossroads, I interviewed executives and analyzed corporate climate actions and environmental performance of Global 500 and S&P 500 companies over the past decade. These companies’ climate decisions are driven by a complex interplay of pressures from existing and future laws and the need to earn goodwill with employees, customers, investors, regulators, and others. States wield influence, too In the United States, state climate regulations affect multinational corporations. That’s especially true in California—the world’s fourth-largest economy and the state with the largest population. While President Donald Trump dismantles U.S. climate policies and federal oversight, California and the European Union have moved in the opposite direction, becoming the de facto regulators for global businesses. California’s newly enacted climate laws extend its cap-and-trade program, now called “cap and invest,” which is designed to ratchet down corporate emissions. They also lock in binding targets to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. And they set clean-power levels that rival the European Union’s Green Deal and outpace most national governments. Other states have joined California in committing to meet the goals of the international Paris climate agreement as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance. The bipartisan coalition of 24 governors, from Arizona to Vermont, represents over half of the U.S. population. window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}}); Several states have been considering “polluters pay” laws. These laws would require companies to pay for their contributions to climate change, with the money going into funds for adaptation projects. Vermont and New York passed similar laws in 2024. Climate laws still apply in Europe and elsewhere Outside the U.S., several countries have climate regulations that multinational companies must follow. The European Union remains a primary driver, though it has recently recalibrated its approach to focus on the largest corporations, reducing the administrative burden on smaller firms. The EU’s broader “Fit for 55” framework aims to cut its emissions by 55 percent by 2030 through policies like binding climate reporting rules. Most notably, the carbon tax for goods entering the EU has, as of January 2026, transitioned from a reporting exercise into a direct financial liability—a shift supported by initiatives to boost competitiveness in clean energy and green infrastructure. Beyond Europe, companies face similar emissions reporting requirements in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, California, and cities such as Hong Kong. While companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon. While timelines for some of those laws have shifted, the underlying momentum remains. For example, while California temporarily halted a law requiring companies to publish narrative reports on their climate risks (SB 261), the mandate for hard emissions data (SB 253) remains on track for 2026. This “quantitative yes, qualitative maybe” status means that while companies can pause their storytelling, they must still invest in the hard data infrastructure required to count their carbon. The International Court of Justice gave legal backing to such initiatives in July 2025 when it issued an advisory opinion establishing that countries around the globe have a legal obligation to protect the climate. That decision may ultimately increase pressure on global businesses to reduce their contributions to climate change. Multinationals put pressure on supply chains Multinational companies’ efforts to reduce their climate impact puts pressure on their suppliers—meaning many more companies must take their climate impact into consideration. For instance, U.S.-based Walmart operates over 10,000 stores across 19 countries and is the largest single buyer of goods in the world. That means it faces a wide range of regulations, including tracking and reducing emissions from its suppliers. In 2017, it launched Project Gigaton, aiming to cut 1 gigaton of supply-chain greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Suppliers including Nestle, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Hanes helped the company reach its target six years early through practical measures such as boosting energy efficiency, redesigning packaging, and reducing food waste. While the data is verified through internal quality controls co-developed with NGOs like the Environmental Defense Fund, analysts at Planet Tracker note that these “avoided” emissions haven’t yet stopped Walmart’s absolute footprint from rising alongside its business growth. In early 2025, this growth led Walmart to push back its interim deadlines for two of its most ambitious emissions-reduction targets. Despite these delays, Walmart’s “emissions intensity”—the carbon produced per dollar of revenue—has fallen by roughly 47 percent over the past decade. Moreover, almost half of its electricity worldwide came from renewable energy in 2024, its emissions per unit of revenue fell, and it is still targeting zero emissions from its operations by 2040. There are profits to be made in clean tech In addition to facing pressure from buyers and governments, companies see profits to be made from investing in climate-friendly clean technology. Since 2016, investments in clean energy have outpaced that of fossil fuels globally. This trend has only hastened, with nearly twice as much invested in clean energy as fossil fuels in 2025. window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";r.style.height=d}}}); Lately, myriad new business opportunities for multinational companies and startups alike have focused on meeting AI’s energy demand through clean energy. From 2014 to 2024, the climate tech sector yielded total returns of nearly 200 percent, and U.S. investment in climate tech was still growing in 2025. In the first half of 2025, close to one-fifth of the more than 1,600 venture deals in climate tech were made by corporations for strategic reasons, such as technology access, supply chain integration, or future product offerings. Corporate strategic deals continued to represent about 20 to 23 percent of all climate tech equity transactions through the third and fourth quarters of 2025. However, this surge in investment is more than a search for profit; it is a defensive necessity as the tech industry’s growth begins to collide with its environmental limits. The AI energy paradox The rapid expansion of AI is forcing multinational companies to make explicit choices about their climate priorities. While tech leaders once relied on annual renewable credits to meet climate targets, the scale of the AI power boom is forcing more rigorous carbon accounting. Global data centers are projected to consume more electricity than Japan by 2030, a shift that turns “voluntary” climate investments into a core business requirement for securing 24/7 energy supplies. In 2025, the tech giants’ own reports revealed the scale of AI emissions. Microsoft’s 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report revealed a 23.4 percent increase in total emissions since its 2020 baseline. Similarly, Google’s emissions have climbed 51 percent since 2019, with a 22 percent surge in Scope 3 (supply chain) emissions in 2024 alone. Amazon’s 2024 Sustainability Report noted a 33 percent jump since 2019 driven by the construction of new data centers. Meta’s supplier’s emissions (99 percent of its total footprint) are being driven to new heights by the “embodied carbon” of AI hardware. While high costs might tempt some to cut corners, climate action could instead become a hedge against energy volatility. Companies like Amazon and Google are securing reliable supply by leveraging federal fast-tracking of nuclear permits to act as primary offtakers for the first generation of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). This shift is accelerated by new federal orders to bypass nuclear licensing hurdles, as seen in Google’s landmark agreement with Kairos Power and Amazon’s $500 million investment in X-energy—deals designed to secure the 24/7 “baseload” power AI requires without abandoning carbon-free commitments. Despite their advanced designs, SMRs are still provoking debate over their radioactive waste and the potential risks of deploying nuclear technology closer to populated industrial hubs. Companies look to their customers and the future As climate risks grow alongside political headwinds, companies are facing both pushes toward and pulls away from protecting the planet from catastrophic effects. Oil and gas companies, for example, continue to invest in new oil and gas development. However, they also forecast renewable energy growth accelerating and are investing in clean tech. The corporate leaders I interviewed, from tech companies like Intel to sporting goods and apparel companies like Adidas, talked about aligning sustainability efforts and initiatives across their business globally whenever possible. This proactive approach allows them to more seamlessly collect data and respond to pressures arising domestically and globally, minimizing the need for costly patchwork efforts later. Moreover, global businesses know they will continue to face demands from their customers, investors, and employees to be better stewards of the planet. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges In a 2025 Getty Images survey of over 5,000 consumers across 25 countries, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that they expect clear ESG guidelines from businesses. Furthermore, these consumers—from Brazil, Australia, and Japan to the U.K. and U.S.—are increasingly using GenAI-driven shopping assistants to filter for “responsible business” practices. U.S. market research from the Hartman Group corroborates this trend: 71 percent of surveyed food and beverage consumers consider environmental and social impacts in their purchasing decisions. They increasingly demand credible, tangible, and verifiable evidence. When claims carry third-party certifications, consumers demonstrate significantly higher trust , whereas vague or unsupported claims fuel skepticism. In 2026, the “Climate Crossroads” is a line item on the corporate balance sheet. The divergence between federal deregulation in Washington and the rigid physical demands of the AI revolution has created a new era of corporate pragmatism. While some firms may use political shifts to “greenhush” or delay abstract pledges, the world’s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.

While some firms may use political shifts to “greenhush” or delay abstract pledges, the world’s largest corporations are finding that they cannot simply account away the massive energy and infrastructure requirements of the AI Age. AI-powered consumers are increasingly demanding responsible business and accountability on corporate net-zero pledges. In this new landscape, the global businesses that thrive will be those that build carbon-free foundations, while responding to existing and future laws across the globe.

They can view with the naked eye through a telescope and perceive these spectacular objects as faint smudges that don’t even begin to capture their majesty, or they can capture long-exposure images with astrocameras and display the results on a view screen or computer, which robs the immediacy of the stargazing experience. Stand-alone telescope eyepieces with active light amplification do exist for a real-time viewing, but commercial products are pricey, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars. I wanted something I could use for the public-astronomy observation nights that I organize in my community. So I decided to build a low-cost DIY amplifying eyepiece, to make it easier for visitors to observe deep-sky objects but without requiring a large financial investment on my part. I quickly realized there was already an industry replete with hardware for handling low-light conditions—the security-camera industry. Faced with the challenge of monitoring areas with a variety of lighting, often using cameras spread out over a large facility, makers of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras created a video standard that uses digital sensors to capture images but then transmits them as HD-resolution analog signals over coaxial cables. By using this Analog High Definition (AHD) transmission standard, you can attach new cameras to preexisting long cable runs and still get a high-quality image. A CMOS-image sensor module from a security camera [top left], a USB capture card [bottom left], and an OLED viewfinder [right] process analog video data.James Provost While I didn’t need the long-distance capability of these cameras, I was very interested in their low price and ability to handle dim conditions. The business end of these cameras is a module that integrates a CMOS image sensor with supporting electronics. After some research, I settled on a module that combined a 2-megapixel Sony IMX307 sensor with a supporting NVP2441 chipset. The key factor was choosing a sensor-chipset combination that supports something called Starlight or Sens-Up mode. This makes the camera more sensitive to light than the human eye, albeit at the cost of a little speed. Images are created by integrating approximately 1.2 seconds of exposure time on the sensor. That might make for choppy security footage, but it’s not noticeable when making observations of nebulae and other astronomical objects (unless of course something really weird happens in the sky!) From Astronomy To Security Cameras and Back Again The existence of the Sens-up mode is actually part of the technical heritage of digital imaging sensors. CMOS sensors were developed as a successor to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which were eagerly embraced by the astronomical community following their introduction in 1970, replacing long-exposure photographic plates. However, the ability to take exposure frames as long as one second is rarely something that CCTV cameras are designed for: It can be more of a drawback than a feature, leading to blurred images of moving objects or people. As a result, this capability is rarely mentioned in the product descriptions, and so finding the right module was the most challenging part: I had to buy three different camera modules before finally landing on one that worked. The output from the camera module is passed to a digital viewfinder, which displays both the video and control menus generated by the module. These menus are navigated using a four-way, press-to-select joystick that connects to a dedicated header on the module. The output of the camera is also passed to a capture card that converts the analog signal to digital and provides a USB-C interface, which allows images to be seen and saved using a smartphone. All the electronics can be powered via battery for complete stand-alone operation or from a USB cable attached to the capture card. The analog HD module can be controlled directly using a joystick to navigate onscreen menus. Power can be provided externally via USB-C connector on the capture card or via an optional battery pack.James Provost The components fit in an enclosure I made from 3D-printed parts, designed to match the 32-millimeter diameter of most telescope eyepieces for easy mounting. The whole thing cost less than US $250. Testing out the Amplifying Eyepiece I took my new amplifying eyepiece out with my Celestron C11 telescope to give it a try. Soon I had in my viewfinder the Dumbbell Nebula, also known as Messier 27/M27, which is normally quite hard to see. It was significantly brighter compared to a naked-eye observation. Certainly the difference wasn’t as marked as with a commercial rig that has noise-reducing cooling for the sensor electronics. But it was still an enormous improvement and for a fraction of the cost. The Orion Nebula, some 1,340 light years away.Jordan Blanchard The amplifier is also more versatile: You can remove it from the telescope, and with a 2.8-mm HD lens fitted to the camera-module sensor, you can use it as a night-vision camera. That’s handy when trying to operate in dark outdoor conditions on starry nights! For the future, I’d like to upgrade the USB-C capture module to one that can handle the sensor’s digital output directly, rather than just the analog signal. This would give a noticeable boost in resolution when recording or streaming to a phone or computer. Beyond that, I’m interested in finding another low-cost camera module with a longer exposure, and refining the 3D-printed housing so it’s easier to build and adapt to other observing setups. That way the eyepiece will stay affordable, but people can still push it toward more serious electronically assisted astronomy.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/diy-astrophotography-eyepiece","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-reflecting-telescope-can-be-seen-fitted-with-a-boxy-eyepiece.jpg?id=62609417&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C397%2C0%2C398","publishedAt":"2026-01-04T13:00:01.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"When it comes to viewing nebulae, galaxies, and other deep-sky objects, amateur astronomers on a budget have had two options.

If you can dream it, there’s a good chance it’ll be on display at CES 2026 (though admittedly, much of this tech won’t necessarily make it to the mainstream). There will be a range of AI toys, AI notetakers, and “AI companions,” exoskeletons and humanoid robots, and health tech to track your hormones, brain activity, and... bathroom activity. This year’s event will have keynote addresses from the CEOs of tech giants including AMD and Lenovo, and thousands of booths from companies spanning legacy brands to brand-new startups. I’m excited to stumble across unexpected new tech while wandering the show floor. But as I prepare for this year’s event, here are some of the devices that have already caught my eye. Headphones that can read your brainwaves Electroencephalography, or EEG, has been used in health care for decades to monitor neural activity. It usually involves a person wearing a whole helmet of electrodes, but scaled-down versions of the tech are now being integrated into consumer devices and may soon be ready for users. Several neurotech companies using EEG will be at CES this year. For instance, Neurable (a company we’ve had on our radar for years) is announcing a new headset with gaming brand HyperX, which is meant to help players hone their focus by tracking brain activity in real time. Neurable’s over-ear EEG headphones for everyday use are now available for preorder. Naox will also bring its in-ear EEG tech to consumer-oriented earbuds. And Elemind, another company we’ve covered, aims to help you sleep with its headband. With wearables already monitoring vital signs, sleep, and activity, 2026 may be the year our brainwaves join the list of biosignals we can track on a daily basis. A toothbrush to sniff out health issues Sonic toothbrush company Y-Brush is introducing dental tech analyzing another biomarker: smelly breath. The toothbrush itself is y-shaped and looks almost like a dental retainer on a stick, with bristles surrounding the teeth. In the latest version, the Y-Brush Halo, a gas sensor called SmartNose is integrated to analyze breath biomarkers. The company says this allows the toothbrush to detect more than 300 health conditions, including early-stage diabetes and liver disorders. Automatic massage roller to sooth sore muscles RheoFit’s A1 massage roller basically looks like what would happen if a foam roller and a massage chair had a baby. The device automatically rolls itself down your spine and offers two replaceable surfaces: one harder material that mimics a masseuse’s knuckles, and a gentler option that’s meant to feel more like an open palm. This will be the second year the RheoFit A1 is on display. To find out whether it’s worth the US $449 price tag, I’ll have to try it out on site. Minimalist e-ink smartphone to cut out distractions Just before last year’s CES, several devices were awarded a new certification meant to reward tech designed to be less distracting. While most exhibitors will keep competing for our attention, a few are tapping into a desire for calm and clarity. Minimalist tech company Mudita, for instance, will be showing its e-ink smartphone, which began shipping in 2025. The phone is designed to reduce screen time with its black-and-white, paperlike display, and the operating system is designed to run without Google. Like other not-as-smart phones (such as the Wisephone or Light Phone), the Mudita Kompakt offers the essentials—messaging, maps, camera, and so forth—without constant notifications. Food allergen detector to avoid anaphylaxis Some new tech surprises users with an experience they didn’t know they wanted. Others aim to offer the solutions you’ve dreamt about. For me, French startup Allergen Alert falls into the second category. The startup, one of the listed exhibitors at an early press event on 4 January, is developing a portable system to test food allergens in real time. I’ve been eating gluten-free for most of my life (not by choice), and I know how easily allergens can sneak into a dish with just a sprinkle of flour, or a dash of soy sauce—especially when you’re traveling or eating out. For many people with severe allergies, a device like this could be a lifesaver. This story was updated on 5 January, 2026 to add that Neurable announced a new headset with HyperX. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the company was displaying its MW75 Neuro at CES.

[ Ground Control Robotics ] Well this has to be one of the most “watch a robot do this task entirely through the magic of jump cuts” I’ve ever seen. [ UBTECH ] Very satisfying sound on this one. [ Pudu Robotics ] Welcome to the AgileX Robotics Data Collection Facility, where real robots build the foundation for universal embodied intelligence. Our core mission? Enable large-scale data sharing and reuse across dual-arm teleoperation robots of diverse morphologies, breaking down data silos that slow down AI progress. [ AgileX ] I’m not sure how much thought was put into this, but giving a service robot an explicit cat face could be a good way of moderating expectations on its behavior and interactivity. [ Pudu Robotics ] UBTECH says they have built 1,000 of their Walker S2 humanoid robots, over 500 of which are “delivered & working.” I would very much like to know what “working” means in this context. [ UBTECH ] Every story has its beginning, and ours started in 2023—a year defined by the unknown. Let technology return to passion; let trials catalyze evolution. Embracing growth, embarking on a new journey. We’ll see you at the next stop. Please, please hire someone to do some HRI (human-robot interface) design.

Antonovich admits the accordion isn’t the coolest instrument. It was chosen for him by his mother when he was 8, and he quickly lost interest as a teenager. While growing up close to Moscow, his adolescent passions were instead channeled into electronics and tinkering with gadgets in after-school classes. This led to a career working on environmental-monitoring devices, sensors for commercial drones, and most recently, sensor systems at autonomous-vehicle developer Avride’s R&D hub in Austin, Texas. Sergey Antonovich Employer Avride Occupation Embedded systems developer Education Master’s degree in engineering physics, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute But when Antonovich picked his accordion back up as an adult, he discovered both latent musical skills and a newfound appreciation for the instrument. Like any good tinkerer, he had some ideas about how he could improve it and he soon began using his electronics knowledge to build custom devices. And Antonovich says he’s found a surprising harmony between his day job and his hobby. Whether you’re ensuring that an autonomous vehicle spots obstacles in the road in time or translating a musician’s nimble finger work into a melodious tune, you need to rapidly process digital signals from the underlying hardware. “Both systems, self-driving cars and accordions, are real-time embedded systems,” says Antonovich. “A self-driving car is more complicated because it contains many more components, but the principles are more or less equal.” Electronics Trumps Music Antonovich grew up in Chekhov, a small town outside Moscow, and says he had a pretty ordinary childhood. His father passed away when he was only 1, so he was brought up by his mother, who worked in the printing industry, and his grandmother, a school principal who taught Russian. At 8 he was enrolled in a local music school where he learned the fundamentals of music theory and the accordion. He was a dutiful student, he says, but never felt much passion for the instrument his mother picked for him and stopped playing when he was about 15. Sergey Antonovich shows off the digital instruments he makes in his free time. With one lightweight instrument, he becomes a one-man band. Sergey Antonovich That was also when Antonovich had his first encounter with the world of electronics. He started attending after-school classes where he was taught to solder and build simple electronic systems. Antonovich quickly caught the bug and was soon knocking together digital doorbells, code locks, and basic radio receivers in his spare time. His family encouraged him to enroll at a technical secondary school, which taught engineering skills alongside the standard curriculum. When it came to picking a university, he decided he wanted a grounding in physics, so he enrolled at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute in 2004, choosing a program that taught a combination of hardware, software, and digital-signal processing. Antonovich originally planned to become a software developer but quickly fell in love with hardware. “When you develop software, there is a level of abstraction between you and the thing itself,” he says. “But when you work with hardware, you understand how this particular thing actually works.” Embedding Into a Career Toward the end of his degree studies, in 2009, Antonovich started working for Moscow-based Ecosfera, a company focused on environmental and labor-safety measurement devices. He continued working for the company after graduating in 2010, designing hardware and software to measure conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to ensure safe workplaces. It was a niche field, but one with strict regulatory requirements, and he had to shepherd his devices through rigorous certification procedures, the first major accomplishment of his career. From there, he worked for a variety of companies on different embedded and Internet of Things systems, including ATMs, medical devices, sensors for commercial drones, and digital price tags. Then in 2021 he interviewed at internet company Yandex, which operates Russia’s most popular search engine, to work on its autonomous vehicle program. “I remember I was approaching the office entrance and I saw a car which was driving itself,” Antonovich says. “You see it on YouTube, but it’s not such an inspiring experience. It’s really inspiring when you see it live.” He got the job and started work as a software engineer developing vehicle sensor systems and testing infrastructure. A corporate restructuring saw Yandex’s autonomous vehicle division spun off as a new company called Avride. Antonovich worked for the company in Israel for about a year, then in 2024 moved to its new headquarters in Austin. Antonovich says he works at Arvide primarily on the data that feed the vehicle’s perception algorithms, which includes radar and lidar. Both kinds of sensors have strengths and weaknesses—radar has long range but low resolution, while lidar is great at picking out shapes but only up to a certain distance—so the algorithmic perception system combines the data. Antonovich’s job is to build the diagnostic systems that ensure these sensors are working in perfect synchrony and deliver data within tight time limits. In his day job, Antonovich works on the sensor systems for self-driving cars. Sergey Antonovich Moving to the United States has been a positive change for Antonovich. On a professional front, the country’s soft-touch regulatory approach toward autonomous vehicles has allowed the company to make rapid progress on its technology. But he says the move has also helped him indulge his tinkering instincts in his spare time. “As a maker, I would say [the United States] is a paradise,” he says. “Electronic components are very accessible. You just order them and they arrive very quickly and everything just works.” Antonovich has taken full advantage of this to dive into his other passion—building musical instruments. A Musical Repris In 2017, when he was still living in Russia, Antonovich noticed a new generation of digital accordions emerging and it sparked his curiosity. “I thought, why not try to modify my own [acoustic] accordion?” he says. He dusted off his instrument and was gratified to find that he could still play and read sheet music. So, he tried to tackle some of the problems that beset digital accordions. Commercially available instruments are typically large and heavy, rely on bulky external modules to add musical accompaniment such as a drum beat, and connect to amplifiers with wires that restrict the performer’s movement. “I decided that maybe I can build a self-contained device,” he says. Starting with an acoustic accordion as a base, he added a synthesizer, installed internal microphones to capture acoustic sounds that could then be blended with digital ones, and integrated wireless transmitters that could free performers from cables and let them move about the stage freely. Surprisingly, Antonovich found a lot of overlap with his work on self-driving cars—in particular, the need to manage latency along the signal-processing chain. To provide a seamless experience to the player, a digital accordion needs to rapidly route input from dozens of buttons and keys on two separate keyboards to the synthesizer, which has its own processing delay. “Your main task as a developer is to keep latency as low as possible,” he says. “A high quality system should produce sound in less than 10 milliseconds, and if you come over this threshold it’s very uncomfortable to play.” Antonovich now has a growing menagerie of both hybrid acoustic-digital and fully digital accordions. But while he’s built accordions for friends, he’s in no hurry to turn his hobby into a business. “Making them a commercial product will turn my curiosity to necessity,” he says. “When you do something for a living, you do it because you have to and not because you choose to.”","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/digital-accordions-autonomous-car-system","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-wearing-cowboy-hat-holding-an-accordion-beige-shirt-gray-pants-and-carrying-a-bag.jpg?id=62609259&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C187%2C0%2C188","publishedAt":"2026-01-02T13:00:02.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"When Sergey Antonovich rediscovered a childhood passion for music, he found an unexpected application for his skills as an embedded systems engineer: building bespoke digital accordions.

Often these projects fly under the radar of the popular technology press, which these days seems more interested in the personalities driving Big Tech companies than in the technology itself. We go our own way here, getting out into the field to bring you news of the hidden gems that genuinely—as the IEEE motto goes—advance technology for the benefit of humanity. A look back at the last 20 years of January issues reveals that while we’ve certainly covered our share of huge tech projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope, many of the stories touch on subjects most people would have otherwise missed. Last January, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz reported on startups that are piloting ocean-based carbon capture. This issue, she’s back with another CO2-centric story, this time focused on grid-scale storage, which is poised to blow up—literally. Waltz traveled to Sardinia to check out Milan-based Energy Dome’s “bubble battery,” which can store up to 200 megawatt-hours by compressing and decompressing pure carbon dioxide inside an inflatable dome. This kind of modular, easy-to-deploy energy storage could be especially useful for AI data centers, says Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, who curated this issue and wrote about gravity energy storage back in January 2021. Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquefy cancer tumors. “When we think about energy storage, our minds usually go to grid-scale batteries,” Moore says. “Yet these bubbles, which are in many ways more capable than batteries, will be sprouting up all over the place, often in association with computing infrastructure.” For his story in this issue, Moore dove into the competition between two startups that are developing radio-based cables to replace conventional copper cables and fiber optics in data centers. These radio systems can connect processors 10 to 20 meters apart using a third of the power of optical-fiber cables and at a third of the cost. The next step is to integrate the radio connections directly with GPUs, to ease cooling burdens and help data centers and the AI models running on them continue to scale up. Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquify cancer tumors, as Greg Uyeno found when reporting on HistoSonics’ ultrasound treatment. Feared for its aggressive nature and extremely low survival rate, pancreatic cancer kills almost half a million people per year worldwide. HistoSonics uses noninvasive, focused ultrasound to create cavitation bubbles that destroy tumors without dangerously heating surrounding tissue. This year, the company is concluding kidney trials as well as launching pancreatic cancer trials. Over the last two decades, Spectrum has regularly covered the rise of drones. In 2018, for instance, we reported that the startup Zipline would deploy autonomous drones to deliver blood and medical supplies in rural Rwanda. Today, Zipline has a market cap of about US $4 billion and operates in several African countries, Japan, and the United States, having completed almost 2 million drone deliveries. In this issue, journalist Robb Mandelbaum takes us inside the Wildfire XPrize competition, aimed at providing another life-saving service: dousing wildfires before they grow out of control. Zipline succeeded because it could make deliveries to remote locations much faster than land vehicles. This year’s XPrize teams plan to detect and suppress fires faster than conventional firefighting methods. In addition to these emerging technologies, we’ve packed this issue with a dozen others, including Porsche’s wireless home charger for EVs, the world’s first electric air taxi service, neutral-atom quantum computers, interoperable mesh networks, and robotic baseball umpires.

He pioneered the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to train deep learning models in the late 2000s with his students at Stanford University, cofounded Google Brain in 2011, and then served for three years as chief scientist for Baidu, where he helped build the Chinese tech giant’s AI group. So when he says he has identified the next big shift in artificial intelligence, people listen. And that’s what he told IEEE Spectrum in an exclusive Q&A. Landing AI, which built a platform called LandingLens to help manufacturers improve visual inspection with computer vision. He has also become something of an evangelist for what he calls the data-centric AI movement, which he says can yield “small data” solutions to big issues in AI, including model efficiency, accuracy, and bias. What’s next for really big models The career advice he didn’t listen to Defining the data-centric AI movement Synthetic data Why Landing AI asks its customers to do the work The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an unsustainable trajectory. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way? Andrew Ng: This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions. When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that? Ng: This is a term coined by Percy Liang and some of my friends at Stanford to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, GPT-3 is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them. What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video? Ng: I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision. Back to top It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users. Ng: Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the Google Brain project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation. I remember when my students and I published the first NeurIPS workshop paper advocating using CUDA, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince. I expect they’re both convinced now. Ng: I think so, yes. Back to top How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement? Ng: Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data. The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up. You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them? Ng: You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn. When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set? Ng: Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of RetinaNet. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system. For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance. Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training? Ng: Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, Olga Russakovsky gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed Mary Gray’s presentation, which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like Datasheets for Datasets also seem like an important piece of the puzzle. When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly? Ng: In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a Jupyter notebook and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity. Back to top What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution? Ng: I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, Anima Anandkumar gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development. Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets? Ng: Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category. Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data. Back to top To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches Landing AI and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment? Ng: When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the LandingLens platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data. How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up? Ng: It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations. So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work. Ng: Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains. Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement? Ng: In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains. Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement? Ng: In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

Engineers and designers can do only so much to miniaturize transistors and pack as many of them as possible into chips. So they’re turning to other approaches to chip design, incorporating technologies like AI into the process. Samsung, for instance, is adding AI to its memory chips to enable processing in memory, thereby saving energy and speeding up machine learning. Speaking of speed, Google’s TPU V4 AI chip has doubled its processing power compared with that of its previous version. But AI holds still more promise and potential for the semiconductor industry. To better understand how AI is set to revolutionize chip design, we spoke with Heather Gorr, senior product manager for MathWorks’ MATLAB platform. How is AI currently being used to design the next generation of chips? Heather Gorr: AI is such an important technology because it’s involved in most parts of the cycle, including the design and manufacturing process. There’s a lot of important applications here, even in the general process engineering where we want to optimize things. I think defect detection is a big one at all phases of the process, especially in manufacturing. But even thinking ahead in the design process, [AI now plays a significant role] when you’re designing the light and the sensors and all the different components. There’s a lot of anomaly detection and fault mitigation that you really want to consider. Heather GorrMathWorks Then, thinking about the logistical modeling that you see in any industry, there is always planned downtime that you want to mitigate; but you also end up having unplanned downtime. So, looking back at that historical data of when you’ve had those moments where maybe it took a bit longer than expected to manufacture something, you can take a look at all of that data and use AI to try to identify the proximate cause or to see something that might jump out even in the processing and design phases. We think of AI oftentimes as a predictive tool, or as a robot doing something, but a lot of times you get a lot of insight from the data through AI. What are the benefits of using AI for chip design? Gorr: Historically, we’ve seen a lot of physics-based modeling, which is a very intensive process. We want to do a reduced order model, where instead of solving such a computationally expensive and extensive model, we can do something a little cheaper. You could create a surrogate model, so to speak, of that physics-based model, use the data, and then do your parameter sweeps, your optimizations, your Monte Carlo simulations using the surrogate model. That takes a lot less time computationally than solving the physics-based equations directly. So, we’re seeing that benefit in many ways, including the efficiency and economy that are the results of iterating quickly on the experiments and the simulations that will really help in the design. So it’s like having a digital twin in a sense? Gorr: Exactly. That’s pretty much what people are doing, where you have the physical system model and the experimental data. Then, in conjunction, you have this other model that you could tweak and tune and try different parameters and experiments that let sweep through all of those different situations and come up with a better design in the end. So, it’s going to be more efficient and, as you said, cheaper? Gorr: Yeah, definitely. Especially in the experimentation and design phases, where you’re trying different things. That’s obviously going to yield dramatic cost savings if you’re actually manufacturing and producing [the chips]. You want to simulate, test, experiment as much as possible without making something using the actual process engineering. We’ve talked about the benefits. How about the drawbacks? Gorr: The [AI-based experimental models] tend to not be as accurate as physics-based models. Of course, that’s why you do many simulations and parameter sweeps. But that’s also the benefit of having that digital twin, where you can keep that in mind—it’s not going to be as accurate as that precise model that we’ve developed over the years. Both chip design and manufacturing are system intensive; you have to consider every little part. And that can be really challenging. It’s a case where you might have models to predict something and different parts of it, but you still need to bring it all together. One of the other things to think about too is that you need the data to build the models. You have to incorporate data from all sorts of different sensors and different sorts of teams, and so that heightens the challenge. How can engineers use AI to better prepare and extract insights from hardware or sensor data? Gorr: We always think about using AI to predict something or do some robot task, but you can use AI to come up with patterns and pick out things you might not have noticed before on your own. People will use AI when they have high-frequency data coming from many different sensors, and a lot of times it’s useful to explore the frequency domain and things like data synchronization or resampling. Those can be really challenging if you’re not sure where to start. One of the things I would say is, use the tools that are available. There’s a vast community of people working on these things, and you can find lots of examples [of applications and techniques] on GitHub or MATLAB Central, where people have shared nice examples, even little apps they’ve created. I think many of us are buried in data and just not sure what to do with it, so definitely take advantage of what’s already out there in the community. You can explore and see what makes sense to you, and bring in that balance of domain knowledge and the insight you get from the tools and AI. What should engineers and designers consider when using AI for chip design? Gorr: Think through what problems you’re trying to solve or what insights you might hope to find, and try to be clear about that. Consider all of the different components, and document and test each of those different parts. Consider all of the people involved, and explain and hand off in a way that is sensible for the whole team. How do you think AI will affect chip designers’ jobs? Gorr: It’s going to free up a lot of human capital for more advanced tasks. We can use AI to reduce waste, to optimize the materials, to optimize the design, but then you still have that human involved whenever it comes to decision-making. I think it’s a great example of people and technology working hand in hand. It’s also an industry where all people involved—even on the manufacturing floor—need to have some level of understanding of what’s happening, so this is a great industry for advancing AI because of how we test things and how we think about them before we put them on the chip. How do you envision the future of AI and chip design? Gorr: It’s very much dependent on that human element—involving people in the process and having that interpretable model. We can do many things with the mathematical minutiae of modeling, but it comes down to how people are using it, how everybody in the process is understanding and applying it. Communication and involvement of people of all skill levels in the process are going to be really important. We’re going to see less of those superprecise predictions and more transparency of information, sharing, and that digital twin—not only using AI but also using our human knowledge and all of the work that many people have done over the years.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-chip-design-matlab","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/layered-rendering-of-colorful-semiconductor-wafers-with-a-bright-white-light-sitting-on-one.jpg?id=29285079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C156","publishedAt":"2022-02-08T14:00:01.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"The end of Moore’s Law is looming.

Of these challenges two critical issues stand out: miniaturization and qubit quality. IBM has adopted the superconducting qubit road map of reaching a 1,121-qubit processor by 2023, leading to the expectation that 1,000 qubits with today’s qubit form factor is feasible. However, current approaches will require very large chips (50 millimeters on a side, or larger) at the scale of small wafers, or the use of chiplets on multichip modules. While this approach will work, the aim is to attain a better path toward scalability. Now researchers at MIT have been able to both reduce the size of the qubits and done so in a way that reduces the interference that occurs between neighboring qubits. The MIT researchers have increased the number of superconducting qubits that can be added onto a device by a factor of 100. “We are addressing both qubit miniaturization and quality,” said William Oliver, the director for the Center for Quantum Engineering at MIT. “Unlike conventional transistor scaling, where only the number really matters, for qubits, large numbers are not sufficient, they must also be high-performance. Sacrificing performance for qubit number is not a useful trade in quantum computing. They must go hand in hand.” The key to this big increase in qubit density and reduction of interference comes down to the use of two-dimensional materials, in particular the 2D insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The MIT researchers demonstrated that a few atomic monolayers of hBN can be stacked to form the insulator in the capacitors of a superconducting qubit. Just like other capacitors, the capacitors in these superconducting circuits take the form of a sandwich in which an insulator material is sandwiched between two metal plates. The big difference for these capacitors is that the superconducting circuits can operate only at extremely low temperatures—less than 0.02 degrees above absolute zero (-273.15 °C). Superconducting qubits are measured at temperatures as low as 20 millikelvin in a dilution refrigerator.Nathan Fiske/MIT In that environment, insulating materials that are available for the job, such as PE-CVD silicon oxide or silicon nitride, have quite a few defects that are too lossy for quantum computing applications. To get around these material shortcomings, most superconducting circuits use what are called coplanar capacitors. In these capacitors, the plates are positioned laterally to one another, rather than on top of one another. As a result, the intrinsic silicon substrate below the plates and to a smaller degree the vacuum above the plates serve as the capacitor dielectric. Intrinsic silicon is chemically pure and therefore has few defects, and the large size dilutes the electric field at the plate interfaces, all of which leads to a low-loss capacitor. The lateral size of each plate in this open-face design ends up being quite large (typically 100 by 100 micrometers) in order to achieve the required capacitance. In an effort to move away from the large lateral configuration, the MIT researchers embarked on a search for an insulator that has very few defects and is compatible with superconducting capacitor plates. “We chose to study hBN because it is the most widely used insulator in 2D material research due to its cleanliness and chemical inertness,” said colead author Joel Wang, a research scientist in the Engineering Quantum Systems group of the MIT Research Laboratory for Electronics. On either side of the hBN, the MIT researchers used the 2D superconducting material, niobium diselenide. One of the trickiest aspects of fabricating the capacitors was working with the niobium diselenide, which oxidizes in seconds when exposed to air, according to Wang. This necessitates that the assembly of the capacitor occur in a glove box filled with argon gas. While this would seemingly complicate the scaling up of the production of these capacitors, Wang doesn’t regard this as a limiting factor. “What determines the quality factor of the capacitor are the two interfaces between the two materials,” said Wang. “Once the sandwich is made, the two interfaces are “sealed” and we don’t see any noticeable degradation over time when exposed to the atmosphere.” This lack of degradation is because around 90 percent of the electric field is contained within the sandwich structure, so the oxidation of the outer surface of the niobium diselenide does not play a significant role anymore. This ultimately makes the capacitor footprint much smaller, and it accounts for the reduction in cross talk between the neighboring qubits. “The main challenge for scaling up the fabrication will be the wafer-scale growth of hBN and 2D superconductors like [niobium diselenide], and how one can do wafer-scale stacking of these films,” added Wang. Wang believes that this research has shown 2D hBN to be a good insulator candidate for superconducting qubits. He says that the groundwork the MIT team has done will serve as a road map for using other hybrid 2D materials to build superconducting circuits.","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/2d-hbn-qubit","imageUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-golden-square-package-holds-a-small-processor-sitting-on-top-is-a-metal-square-with-mit-etched-into-it.jpg?id=29281587&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C156%2C0%2C156","publishedAt":"2022-02-07T16:12:05.000Z","sourceName":"IEEE Spectrum","sourceType":"editorial","text":"Quantum computing is a devilishly complex technology, with many technical hurdles impacting its development.
